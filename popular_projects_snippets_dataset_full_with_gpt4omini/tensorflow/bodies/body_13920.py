"""Computes the (Shannon) cross entropy.

    Denote this distribution (`self`) by `P` and the `other` distribution by
    `Q`. Assuming `P, Q` are absolutely continuous with respect to
    one another and permit densities `p(x) dr(x)` and `q(x) dr(x)`, (Shanon)
    cross entropy is defined as:

    ```none
    H[P, Q] = E_p[-log q(X)] = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x)
    ```

    where `F` denotes the support of the random variable `X ~ P`.

    Args:
      other: `tfp.distributions.Distribution` instance.
      name: Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.

    Returns:
      cross_entropy: `self.dtype` `Tensor` with shape `[B1, ..., Bn]`
        representing `n` different calculations of (Shanon) cross entropy.
