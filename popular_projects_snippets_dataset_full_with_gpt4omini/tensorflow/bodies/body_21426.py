"""Start a LooperThread that calls a function periodically.

    If `timer_interval_secs` is None the thread calls `target(args)`
    repeatedly.  Otherwise `target(args)` is called every `timer_interval_secs`
    seconds.  The thread terminates when a stop of the coordinator is
    requested.

    Args:
      coord: A Coordinator.
      timer_interval_secs: Number. Time boundaries at which to call `target`.
      target: A callable object.
      args: Optional arguments to pass to `target` when calling it.
      kwargs: Optional keyword arguments to pass to `target` when calling it.

    Returns:
      The started thread.
