"""Calls the model on new inputs.

    In this case `call` just reapplies
    all ops in the graph to the new inputs
    (e.g. build a new computational graph from the provided inputs).

    Args:
        inputs: A tensor or list of tensors.
        training: Boolean or boolean scalar tensor, indicating whether to run
          the `Network` in training mode or inference mode.
        mask: A mask or list of masks. A mask can be
            either a tensor or None (no mask).

    Returns:
        A tensor if there is a single output, or
        a list of tensors if there are more than one outputs.
