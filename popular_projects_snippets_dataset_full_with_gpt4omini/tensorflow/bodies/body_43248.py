"""Applies a function or op to a number of partially flattened inputs.

  The `inputs` are flattened up to `shallow_tree` before being mapped.

  Use Case:

  Sometimes we wish to apply a function to a partially flattened
  structure (for example when the function itself takes structure inputs). We
  achieve this by specifying a shallow structure, `shallow_tree` we wish to
  flatten up to.

  The `inputs`, can be thought of as having the same structure layout as
  `shallow_tree`, but with leaf nodes that are themselves tree structures.

  This function therefore will return something with the same base structure as
  `shallow_tree`.

  Examples:

  ```python
  shallow_tree = [None, None]
  inp_val = [1, 2, 3]
  out = map_structure_up_to(shallow_tree, lambda x: 2 * x, inp_val)

  # Output is: [2, 4]
  ```

  ```python
  ab_tuple = collections.namedtuple("ab_tuple", "a, b")
  op_tuple = collections.namedtuple("op_tuple", "add, mul")
  inp_val = ab_tuple(a=2, b=3)
  inp_ops = ab_tuple(a=op_tuple(add=1, mul=2), b=op_tuple(add=2, mul=3))
  out = map_structure_up_to(inp_val, lambda val, ops: (val + ops.add) * ops.mul,
                            inp_val, inp_ops)

  # Output is: ab_tuple(a=6, b=15)
  ```

  ```python
  data_list = [[2, 4, 6, 8], [[1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [3, 5, 7]]]
  name_list = ['evens', ['odds', 'primes']]
  out = map_structure_up_to(
      name_list,
      lambda name, sec: "first_{}_{}".format(len(sec), name),
      name_list, data_list)

  # Output is: ['first_4_evens', ['first_5_odds', 'first_3_primes']]
  ```

  Args:
    shallow_tree: a shallow structure, common to all the inputs.
    func: callable which will be applied to each input individually.
    *inputs: structures that are compatible with shallow_tree. The function
        `func` is applied to corresponding structures due to partial flattening
        of each input, so the function must support arity of `len(inputs)`.
    **kwargs: kwargs to feed to func(). Special kwarg
      `check_types` is not passed to func, but instead determines whether the
      types of iterables within the structures have to be same (e.g.
      `map_structure(func, [1], (1,))` raises a `TypeError` exception). To allow
      this set this argument to `False`.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If `shallow_tree` is a nested structure but `input_tree` is not.
    TypeError: If the structure types of `shallow_tree` are different from
      `input_tree`.
    ValueError: If the structure lengths of `shallow_tree` are different from
      `input_tree`.

  Returns:
    result of repeatedly applying `func`, with the same structure layout as
    `shallow_tree`.
