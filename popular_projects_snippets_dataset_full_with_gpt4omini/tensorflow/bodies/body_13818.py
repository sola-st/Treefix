"""Returns the (log o det o Jacobian o inverse)(y).

    Mathematically, returns: `log(det(dX/dY))(Y)`. (Recall that: `X=g^{-1}(Y)`.)

    Note that `forward_log_det_jacobian` is the negative of this function,
    evaluated at `g^{-1}(y)`.

    Args:
      y: `Tensor`. The input to the "inverse" Jacobian determinant evaluation.
      event_ndims: Number of dimensions in the probabilistic events being
        transformed. Must be greater than or equal to
        `self.inverse_min_event_ndims`. The result is summed over the final
        dimensions to produce a scalar Jacobian determinant for each event,
        i.e. it has shape `y.shape.ndims - event_ndims` dimensions.
      name: The name to give this op.

    Returns:
      `Tensor`, if this bijector is injective.
        If not injective, returns the tuple of local log det
        Jacobians, `log(det(Dg_i^{-1}(y)))`, where `g_i` is the restriction
        of `g` to the `ith` partition `Di`.

    Raises:
      TypeError: if `self.dtype` is specified and `y.dtype` is not
        `self.dtype`.
      NotImplementedError: if `_inverse_log_det_jacobian` is not implemented.
