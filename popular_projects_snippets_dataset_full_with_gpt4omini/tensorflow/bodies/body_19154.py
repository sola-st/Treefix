"""Do a backward graph walk and return all the visited ops.

  Args:
    seed_ops: an iterable of operations from which the backward graph
      walk starts. If a list of tensors is given instead, the seed_ops are set
      to be the generators of those tensors.
    inclusive: if True the given seed_ops are also part of the resulting set.
    within_ops: an iterable of `tf.Operation` within which the search is
      restricted. If `within_ops` is `None`, the search is performed within
      the whole graph.
    within_ops_fn: if provided, a function on ops that should return True iff
      the op is within the graph traversal. This can be used along within_ops,
      in which case an op is within if it is also in within_ops.
    stop_at_ts: an iterable of tensors at which the graph walk stops.
    control_inputs: if True, control inputs will be used while moving backward.
    only_differentiable: if True, only traverse ops which are differentiable.
      This includes natively differentiable ops, or ops with custom gradients.
  Returns:
    A Python set of all the `tf.Operation` behind `seed_ops`.
  Raises:
    TypeError: if `seed_ops` or `within_ops` cannot be converted to a list of
      `tf.Operation`.
