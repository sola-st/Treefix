# Extracted from ./data/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/distributions/util.py
"""Computes the inverse softplus, i.e., x = softplus_inverse(softplus(x)).

  Mathematically this op is equivalent to:

  ```none
  softplus_inverse = log(exp(x) - 1.)
  ```

  Args:
    x: `Tensor`. Non-negative (not enforced), floating-point.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    `Tensor`. Has the same type/shape as input `x`.

    # We begin by deriving a more numerically stable softplus_inverse:
    # x = softplus(y) = Log[1 + exp{y}], (which means x > 0).
    # ==> exp{x} = 1 + exp{y}                                (1)
    # ==> y = Log[exp{x} - 1]                                (2)
    #       = Log[(exp{x} - 1) / exp{x}] + Log[exp{x}]
    #       = Log[(1 - exp{-x}) / 1] + Log[exp{x}]
    #       = Log[1 - exp{-x}] + x                           (3)
    # (2) is the "obvious" inverse, but (3) is more stable than (2) for large x.
    # For small x (e.g. x = 1e-10), (3) will become -inf since 1 - exp{-x} will
    # be zero. To fix this, we use 1 - exp{-x} approx x for small x > 0.
    #
    # In addition to the numerically stable derivation above, we clamp
    # small/large values to be congruent with the logic in:
    # tensorflow/core/kernels/softplus_op.h
    #
    # Finally, we set the input to one whenever the input is too large or too
    # small. This ensures that no unchosen codepath is +/- inf. This is
    # necessary to ensure the gradient doesn't get NaNs. Recall that the
    # gradient of `where` behaves like `pred*pred_true + (1-pred)*pred_false`
    # thus an `inf` in an unselected path results in `0*inf=nan`. We are careful
    # to overwrite `x` with ones only when we will never actually use this
    # value. Note that we use ones and not zeros since `log(expm1(0.)) = -inf`.
