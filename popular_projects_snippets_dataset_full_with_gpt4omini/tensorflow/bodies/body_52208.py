"""Allows feature columns to be sorted in Python 3 as they are in Python 2.

    Feature columns need to occasionally be sortable, for example when used as
    keys in a features dictionary passed to a layer.

    In CPython, `__lt__` must be defined for all objects in the
    sequence being sorted. If any objects do not have an `__lt__` compatible
    with feature column objects (such as strings), then CPython will fall back
    to using the `__gt__` method below.
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort

    Args:
      other: The other object to compare to.

    Returns:
      True if the string representation of this object is lexicographically less
      than the string representation of `other`. For FeatureColumn objects,
      this looks like "<__main__.FeatureColumn object at 0xa>".
