"""Merge several accumulators to a single accumulator.

    This method takes the partial values in several accumulators and combines
    them into a single accumulator. This computation must not be order-specific
    (that is, merge([a, b]) must return the same result as merge([b, a]).

    Args:
      accumulators: the accumulators to merge, as a list.

    Returns:
      A merged accumulator.
