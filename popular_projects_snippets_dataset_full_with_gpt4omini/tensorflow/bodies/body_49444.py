"""Registers an object with the Keras serialization framework.

  This decorator injects the decorated class or function into the Keras custom
  object dictionary, so that it can be serialized and deserialized without
  needing an entry in the user-provided custom object dict. It also injects a
  function that Keras will call to get the object's serializable string key.

  Note that to be serialized and deserialized, classes must implement the
  `get_config()` method. Functions do not have this requirement.

  The object will be registered under the key 'package>name' where `name`,
  defaults to the object name if not passed.

  Args:
    package: The package that this class belongs to.
    name: The name to serialize this class under in this package. If None, the
      class' name will be used.

  Returns:
    A decorator that registers the decorated class with the passed names.
