"""Compute a step in this computation, returning a new accumulator.

    This method computes a step of the computation described by this Combiner.
    If an accumulator is passed, the data in that accumulator is also used; so
    compute(batch_values) results in f(batch_values), while
    compute(batch_values, accumulator) results in
    merge(f(batch_values), accumulator).

    Args:
      batch_values: A list of ndarrays representing the values of the inputs for
        this step of the computation.
      accumulator: the current accumulator. Can be None.

    Returns:
      An accumulator that includes the passed batch of inputs.
