"""Log cumulative distribution function.

    Given random variable `X`, the cumulative distribution function `cdf` is:

    ```none
    log_cdf(x) := Log[ P[X <= x] ]
    ```

    Often, a numerical approximation can be used for `log_cdf(x)` that yields
    a more accurate answer than simply taking the logarithm of the `cdf` when
    `x << -1`.

    Args:
      value: `float` or `double` `Tensor`.
      name: Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.

    Returns:
      logcdf: a `Tensor` of shape `sample_shape(x) + self.batch_shape` with
        values of type `self.dtype`.
