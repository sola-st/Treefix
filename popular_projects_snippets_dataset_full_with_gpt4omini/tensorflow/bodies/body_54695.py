"""Sets the global random seed.

  Operations that rely on a random seed actually derive it from two seeds:
  the global and operation-level seeds. This sets the global seed.

  Its interactions with operation-level seeds is as follows:

    1. If neither the global seed nor the operation seed is set: A randomly
      picked seed is used for this op.
    2. If the global seed is set, but the operation seed is not:
      The system deterministically picks an operation seed in conjunction with
      the global seed so that it gets a unique random sequence. Within the
      same version of tensorflow and user code, this sequence is deterministic.
      However across different versions, this sequence might change. If the
      code depends on particular seeds to work, specify both global
      and operation-level seeds explicitly.
    3. If the operation seed is set, but the global seed is not set:
      A default global seed and the specified operation seed are used to
      determine the random sequence.
    4. If both the global and the operation seed are set:
      Both seeds are used in conjunction to determine the random sequence.

  To illustrate the user-visible effects, consider these examples:

  If neither the global seed nor the operation seed is set, we get different
  results for every call to the random op and every re-run of the program:

  ```python
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A1'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A2'
  ```

  (now close the program and run it again)

  ```python
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A3'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A4'
  ```

  If the global seed is set but the operation seed is not set, we get different
  results for every call to the random op, but the same sequence for every
  re-run of the program:

  ```python
  tf.random.set_seed(1234)
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A1'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A2'
  ```

  (now close the program and run it again)

  ```python
  tf.random.set_seed(1234)
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A1'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1]))  # generates 'A2'
  ```

  The reason we get 'A2' instead 'A1' on the second call of `tf.random.uniform`
  above is because the second call uses a different operation seed.

  Note that `tf.function` acts like a re-run of a program in this case. When
  the global seed is set but operation seeds are not set, the sequence of random
  numbers are the same for each `tf.function`. For example:

  ```python
  tf.random.set_seed(1234)

  @tf.function
  def f():
    a = tf.random.uniform([1])
    b = tf.random.uniform([1])
    return a, b

  @tf.function
  def g():
    a = tf.random.uniform([1])
    b = tf.random.uniform([1])
    return a, b

  print(f())  # prints '(A1, A2)'
  print(g())  # prints '(A1, A2)'
  ```

  If the operation seed is set, we get different results for every call to the
  random op, but the same sequence for every re-run of the program:

  ```python
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A1'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A2'
  ```

  (now close the program and run it again)

  ```python
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A1'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A2'
  ```

  The reason we get 'A2' instead 'A1' on the second call of `tf.random.uniform`
  above is because the same `tf.random.uniform` kernel (i.e. internal
  representation) is used by TensorFlow for all calls of it with the same
  arguments, and the kernel maintains an internal counter which is incremented
  every time it is executed, generating different results.

  Calling `tf.random.set_seed` will reset any such counters:

  ```python
  tf.random.set_seed(1234)
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A1'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A2'
  tf.random.set_seed(1234)
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A1'
  print(tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1))  # generates 'A2'
  ```

  When multiple identical random ops are wrapped in a `tf.function`, their
  behaviors change because the ops no long share the same counter. For example:

  ```python
  @tf.function
  def foo():
    a = tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1)
    b = tf.random.uniform([1], seed=1)
    return a, b
  print(foo())  # prints '(A1, A1)'
  print(foo())  # prints '(A2, A2)'

  @tf.function
  def bar():
    a = tf.random.uniform([1])
    b = tf.random.uniform([1])
    return a, b
  print(bar())  # prints '(A1, A2)'
  print(bar())  # prints '(A3, A4)'
  ```

  The second call of `foo` returns '(A2, A2)' instead of '(A1, A1)' because
  `tf.random.uniform` maintains an internal counter. If you want `foo` to return
  '(A1, A1)' every time, use the stateless random ops such as
  `tf.random.stateless_uniform`. Also see `tf.random.experimental.Generator` for
  a new set of stateful random ops that use external variables to manage their
  states.
