"""Creates a copy of this object's tensors onto SavedModel graph.

    Needs to be overridden if the class contains tensors that must be saved
    into the graph. This method should update the `object_map` and `tensor_map`
    dictionaries.

    This method is called on all nodes in the Trackable Graph (generated by
    `_trackable_children`). The nodes are traversed in the order defined by
    `_deserialization_dependencies`

    All usages of _map_resources should be migrated to this method.

    Args:
      object_map: A dictionary that maps original Trackables to the copied
        Trackables. This only needs to be updated if the object is a
        tf.function, or if the copied tensors are necessary for checkpointing
        this object.
      tensor_map: Dictionary mapping original tensors to copied tensors.
      options: A `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` object.
      **kwargs: Additional kwargs that may be added at a later time.

    Returns:
      Flat list of original tensors that have been copied.
