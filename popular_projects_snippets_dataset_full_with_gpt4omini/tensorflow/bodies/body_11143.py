r"""PNG-encode an image.

  `image` is a 3-D uint8 or uint16 Tensor of shape `[height, width, channels]`
  where `channels` is:

  *   1: for grayscale.
  *   2: for grayscale + alpha.
  *   3: for RGB.
  *   4: for RGBA.

  The ZLIB compression level, `compression`, can be -1 for the PNG-encoder
  default or a value from 0 to 9.  9 is the highest compression level,
  generating the smallest output, but is slower.

  Args:
    image: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `uint8`, `uint16`.
      3-D with shape `[height, width, channels]`.
    compression: An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. Compression level.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of type `string`.
