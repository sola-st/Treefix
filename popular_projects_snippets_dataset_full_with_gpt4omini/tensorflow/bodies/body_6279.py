"""DEPRECATED: please use `run` instead.

    Run `fn` with input from `iterator` for `iterations` times.

    This method can be used to run a step function for training a number of
    times using input from a dataset.

    Args:
      fn: function to run using this distribution strategy. The function must
        have the following signature: `def fn(context, inputs)`. `context` is an
          instance of `MultiStepContext` that will be passed when `fn` is run.
          `context` can be used to specify the outputs to be returned from `fn`
          by calling `context.set_last_step_output`. It can also be used to
          capture non tensor outputs by `context.set_non_tensor_output`. See
          `MultiStepContext` documentation for more information. `inputs` will
          have same type/structure as `iterator.get_next()`. Typically, `fn`
          will use `call_for_each_replica` method of the strategy to distribute
          the computation over multiple replicas.
      iterator: Iterator of a dataset that represents the input for `fn`. The
        caller is responsible for initializing the iterator as needed.
      iterations: (Optional) Number of iterations that `fn` should be run.
        Defaults to 1.
      initial_loop_values: (Optional) Initial values to be passed into the
        loop that runs `fn`. Defaults to `None`. # TODO(priyag): Remove
          initial_loop_values argument when we have a mechanism to infer the
          outputs of `fn`.

    Returns:
      Returns the `MultiStepContext` object which has the following properties,
      among other things:
        - run_op: An op that runs `fn` `iterations` times.
        - last_step_outputs: A dictionary containing tensors set using
        `context.set_last_step_output`. Evaluating this returns the value of
        the tensors after the last iteration.
        - non_tensor_outputs: A dictionary containing anything that was set by
          `fn` by calling `context.set_non_tensor_output`.
