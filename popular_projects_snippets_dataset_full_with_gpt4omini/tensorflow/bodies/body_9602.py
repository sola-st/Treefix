"""Analyze the step stats and format it into Chrome Trace Format.

    Args:
      show_dataflow: (Optional.) If True, add flow events to the trace
        connecting producers and consumers of tensors.
      show_memory: (Optional.) If True, add object snapshot events to the trace
        showing the sizes and lifetimes of tensors.
      op_time: (Optional.) How the execution time of op is shown in timeline.
        Possible values are "schedule", "gpu" and "all". "schedule" will show op
        from the time it is scheduled to the end of the scheduling. Notice by
        the end of its scheduling its async kernels may not start yet. It is
        shown using the default value from step_stats. "gpu" will show op with
        the execution time of its kernels on GPU. "all" will show op from the
        start of its scheduling to the end of its last kernel.

    Returns:
      A 'StepStatsAnalysis' object.
