""""Generate an array of device index arrays, one for each subchunk.

  In the basic ring reduction algorithm there are size(T)/num_devices
  data chunks and each device process one chunk per tick, i.e. sending
  one chunk and receiving one chunk.  The idea of subchunking is that
  each device processes num_subchunks smaller data regions per tick,
  and the ring rank permutation is different for each subchunk index
  so that a device is potentially sending to and receiving from
  num_subchunks different other devices at each tick.  Where multiple
  independent data channels exist between devices, this strategy
  supplies a method of using them in parallel.

  Args:
    num_workers: number of worker tasks
    num_subchunks: number of subchunks into which to divide each per-GPU chunk.
    gpu_perm: an array of integers in [0, num_gpus-1] giving the default
      ring order of GPUs at each worker.  Other permutations will be generated
      by rotating this array and splicing together per-worker instances.

  Raises:
    ValueError: the number of subchunks may not exceed the number of GPUs.

  Returns:
    pred_by_s_d: list of lists that maps (by index) from (subchunk, dev) to
        preceding device in the permutation for that subchunk.  The
        device index of GPU i at worker j is i + (j * num_gpus).
    rank_by_s_d: list of lists that maps (by index) from (subchunk, dev) to
       local rank of device d in the permutation for that subchunk.
