"""Replace user-provided arguments before they are passed to a test.

    This makes it possible to adjust user-provided arguments before passing
    them to the test method.

    Args:
      kwargs:  The combined arguments for the test.
      requested_parameters: The set of parameters that are defined in the
        signature of the test method.

    Returns:
      A dictionary with updates to `kwargs`.  Keys with values set to
      `ParameterModifier.DO_NOT_PASS_TO_THE_TEST` are going to be deleted and
      not passed to the test.
