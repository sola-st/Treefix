"""Replace obj.attr_name with new_attr.

    This method is smart and works at the module, class, and instance level
    while preserving proper inheritance. It will not stub out C types however
    unless that has been explicitly allowed by the type.

    This method supports the case where attr_name is a staticmethod or a
    classmethod of obj.

    Notes:
      - If obj is an instance, then it is its class that will actually be
        stubbed. Note that the method Set() does not do that: if obj is
        an instance, it (and not its class) will be stubbed.
      - The stubbing is using the builtin getattr and setattr. So, the __get__
        and __set__ will be called when stubbing (TODO: A better idea would
        probably be to manipulate obj.__dict__ instead of getattr() and
        setattr()).

    Args:
      obj: The object whose attributes we want to modify.
      attr_name: The name of the attribute to modify.
      new_attr: The new value for the attribute.

    Raises:
      AttributeError: If the attribute cannot be found.
