"""Try loading the source code inside a .par file.

  A .par file is a zip-compressed, self-contained Python executable.
  It contains the content of individual Python source files that can
  be read only through extracting from the zip file.

  Args:
    source_file_path: The full path to the file inside the .par file. This
      path should include the path to the .par file itself, followed by the
      intra-par path, e.g.,
      "/tmp/my_executable.par/org-tensorflow/tensorflow/python/foo/bar.py".

  Returns:
    If successful, lines of the source file as a `list` of `str`s.
    Else, `None`.
