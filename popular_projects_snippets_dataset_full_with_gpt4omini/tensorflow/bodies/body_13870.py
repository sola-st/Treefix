"""Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined.

    Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a
    Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is
    undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within
    the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is
    undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for
    Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or -
    infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.

    Returns:
      allow_nan_stats: Python `bool`.
