"""Computes SSIM index between img1 and img2.

  This function is based on the standard SSIM implementation from:
  Wang, Z., Bovik, A. C., Sheikh, H. R., & Simoncelli, E. P. (2004). Image
  quality assessment: from error visibility to structural similarity. IEEE
  transactions on image processing.

  Note: The true SSIM is only defined on grayscale.  This function does not
  perform any colorspace transform.  (If the input is already YUV, then it will
  compute YUV SSIM average.)

  Details:
    - 11x11 Gaussian filter of width 1.5 is used.
    - k1 = 0.01, k2 = 0.03 as in the original paper.

  The image sizes must be at least 11x11 because of the filter size.

  Example:

  ```python
      # Read images (of size 255 x 255) from file.
      im1 = tf.image.decode_image(tf.io.read_file('path/to/im1.png'))
      im2 = tf.image.decode_image(tf.io.read_file('path/to/im2.png'))
      tf.shape(im1)  # `img1.png` has 3 channels; shape is `(255, 255, 3)`
      tf.shape(im2)  # `img2.png` has 3 channels; shape is `(255, 255, 3)`
      # Add an outer batch for each image.
      im1 = tf.expand_dims(im1, axis=0)
      im2 = tf.expand_dims(im2, axis=0)
      # Compute SSIM over tf.uint8 Tensors.
      ssim1 = tf.image.ssim(im1, im2, max_val=255, filter_size=11,
                            filter_sigma=1.5, k1=0.01, k2=0.03)

      # Compute SSIM over tf.float32 Tensors.
      im1 = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(im1, tf.float32)
      im2 = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(im2, tf.float32)
      ssim2 = tf.image.ssim(im1, im2, max_val=1.0, filter_size=11,
                            filter_sigma=1.5, k1=0.01, k2=0.03)
      # ssim1 and ssim2 both have type tf.float32 and are almost equal.
  ```

  Args:
    img1: First image batch. 4-D Tensor of shape `[batch, height, width,
      channels]` with only Positive Pixel Values.
    img2: Second image batch. 4-D Tensor of shape `[batch, height, width,
      channels]` with only Positive Pixel Values.
    max_val: The dynamic range of the images (i.e., the difference between the
      maximum the and minimum allowed values).
    filter_size: Default value 11 (size of gaussian filter).
    filter_sigma: Default value 1.5 (width of gaussian filter).
    k1: Default value 0.01
    k2: Default value 0.03 (SSIM is less sensitivity to K2 for lower values, so
      it would be better if we took the values in the range of 0 < K2 < 0.4).
    return_index_map: If True returns local SSIM map instead of the global mean.

  Returns:
    A tensor containing an SSIM value for each image in batch or a tensor
    containing an SSIM value for each pixel for each image in batch if
    return_index_map is True. Returned SSIM values are in range (-1, 1], when
    pixel values are non-negative. Returns a tensor with shape:
    broadcast(img1.shape[:-3], img2.shape[:-3]) or broadcast(img1.shape[:-1],
    img2.shape[:-1]).
