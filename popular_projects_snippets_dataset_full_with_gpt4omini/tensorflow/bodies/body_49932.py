"""Applies cosine decay with restarts to the learning rate.

  When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
  the training progresses.  This function applies a cosine decay function with
  restarts to a provided initial learning rate.  It requires a `global_step`
  value to compute the decayed learning rate.  You can just pass a TensorFlow
  variable that you increment at each training step.

  The function returns the decayed learning rate while taking into account
  possible warm restarts. The learning rate multiplier first decays
  from 1 to `alpha` for `first_decay_steps` steps. Then, a warm
  restart is performed. Each new warm restart runs for `t_mul` times more steps
  and with `m_mul` times smaller initial learning rate.

  Example usage:
  ```python
  first_decay_steps = 1000
  lr_decayed = cosine_decay_restarts(learning_rate, global_step,
                                     first_decay_steps)
  ```

  Args:
    learning_rate: A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number.
      The initial learning rate.
    global_step: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Global
      step to use for the decay computation.
    first_decay_steps: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number.
      Number of steps to decay over.
    t_mul: A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Used to
      derive the number of iterations in the i-th period
    m_mul: A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number.
      Used to derive the initial learning rate of the i-th period:
    alpha: A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. Minimum
      learning rate value as a fraction of the learning_rate.
    name: String. Optional name of the operation.  Defaults to 'SGDRDecay'.

  Returns:
    A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`.  The decayed
    learning rate.
  Raises:
    ValueError: if `global_step` is not supplied.

  @compatibility(eager)
  When eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in
  turn returns the decayed learning rate Tensor. This can be useful for changing
  the learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.
