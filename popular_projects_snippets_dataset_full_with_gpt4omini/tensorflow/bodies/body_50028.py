"""Add ops to apply sparse gradients to the variable `handle`.

    Similar to `_apply_sparse`, the `indices` argument to this method has been
    de-duplicated. Optimizers which deal correctly with non-unique indices may
    instead override `_resource_apply_sparse_duplicate_indices` to avoid this
    overhead.

    Args:
      grad: a `Tensor` representing the gradient for the affected indices.
      handle: a `Tensor` of dtype `resource` which points to the variable to be
        updated.
      indices: a `Tensor` of integral type representing the indices for which
        the gradient is nonzero. Indices are unique.
      apply_state: A dict which is used across multiple apply calls.

    Returns:
      An `Operation` which updates the value of the variable.
