"""Applies sparse addition to individual values or slices in a Variable.

    `ref` is a `Tensor` with rank `P` and `indices` is a `Tensor` of rank `Q`.

    `indices` must be integer tensor, containing indices into `ref`.
    It must be shape `[d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, K]` where `0 < K <= P`.

    The innermost dimension of `indices` (with length `K`) corresponds to
    indices into elements (if `K = P`) or slices (if `K < P`) along the `K`th
    dimension of `ref`.

    `updates` is `Tensor` of rank `Q-1+P-K` with shape:

    ```
    [d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, ref.shape[K], ..., ref.shape[P-1]].
    ```

    For example, say we want to add 4 scattered elements to a rank-1 tensor to
    8 elements. In Python, that update would look like this:

    ```python
        ref = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
        indices = tf.constant([[4], [3], [1] ,[7]])
        updates = tf.constant([9, 10, 11, 12])
        add = ref.scatter_nd_add(indices, updates)
        with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
          print sess.run(add)
    ```

    The resulting update to ref would look like this:

        [1, 13, 3, 14, 14, 6, 7, 20]

    See `tf.scatter_nd` for more details about how to make updates to
    slices.

    Args:
      indices: The indices to be used in the operation.
      updates: The values to be used in the operation.
      name: the name of the operation.

    Returns:
      The updated variable.
