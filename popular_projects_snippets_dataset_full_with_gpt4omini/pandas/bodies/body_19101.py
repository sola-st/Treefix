"""
    Function to emulate the cleaning of a backtick quoted name.

    The purpose for this function is to see what happens to the name of
    identifier if it goes to the process of being parsed a Python code
    inside a backtick quoted string and than being cleaned
    (removed of any special characters).

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : hashable
        Name to be cleaned.

    Returns
    -------
    name : hashable
        Returns the name after tokenizing and cleaning.

    Notes
    -----
        For some cases, a name cannot be converted to a valid Python identifier.
        In that case :func:`tokenize_string` raises a SyntaxError.
        In that case, we just return the name unmodified.

        If this name was used in the query string (this makes the query call impossible)
        an error will be raised by :func:`tokenize_backtick_quoted_string` instead,
        which is not caught and propagates to the user level.

try:
    tokenized = tokenize_string(f"`{name}`")
    tokval = next(tokenized)[1]
    exit(create_valid_python_identifier(tokval))
except SyntaxError:
    exit(name)
