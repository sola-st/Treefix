        Quick access to the backing arrays of the Blocks.

        Only for compatibility with ArrayManager for testing convenience.
        Not to be used in actual code, and return value is not the same as the
        ArrayManager method (list of 1D arrays vs iterator of 2D ndarrays / 1D EAs).

        Warning! The returned arrays don't handle Copy-on-Write, so this should
        be used with caution (only in read-mode).
