"""
        Return the common dtype, if one exists.

        Used in `find_common_type` implementation. This is for example used
        to determine the resulting dtype in a concat operation.

        If no common dtype exists, return None (which gives the other dtypes
        the chance to determine a common dtype). If all dtypes in the list
        return None, then the common dtype will be "object" dtype (this means
        it is never needed to return "object" dtype from this method itself).

        Parameters
        ----------
        dtypes : list of dtypes
            The dtypes for which to determine a common dtype. This is a list
            of np.dtype or ExtensionDtype instances.

        Returns
        -------
        Common dtype (np.dtype or ExtensionDtype) or None
