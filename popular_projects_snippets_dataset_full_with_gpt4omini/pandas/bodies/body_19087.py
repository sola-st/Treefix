"""
        Get specifically scoped variables from a list of stack frames.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stack : list
            A list of stack frames as returned by ``inspect.stack()``
        scopes : sequence of strings
            A sequence containing valid stack frame attribute names that
            evaluate to a dictionary. For example, ('locals', 'globals')
