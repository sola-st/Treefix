"""
        Dtype description as a tuple ``(kind, bit-width, format string, endianness)``.

        Bit-width : the number of bits as an integer
        Format string : data type description format string in Apache Arrow C
                        Data Interface format.
        Endianness : current only native endianness (``=``) is supported

        Notes:
            - Kind specifiers are aligned with DLPack where possible (hence the
              jump to 20, leave enough room for future extension)
            - Masks must be specified as boolean with either bit width 1 (for bit
              masks) or 8 (for byte masks).
            - Dtype width in bits was preferred over bytes
            - Endianness isn't too useful, but included now in case in the future
              we need to support non-native endianness
            - Went with Apache Arrow format strings over NumPy format strings
              because they're more complete from a dataframe perspective
            - Format strings are mostly useful for datetime specification, and
              for categoricals.
            - For categoricals, the format string describes the type of the
              categorical in the data buffer. In case of a separate encoding of
              the categorical (e.g. an integer to string mapping), this can
              be derived from ``self.describe_categorical``.
            - Data types not included: complex, Arrow-style null, binary, decimal,
              and nested (list, struct, map, union) dtypes.
