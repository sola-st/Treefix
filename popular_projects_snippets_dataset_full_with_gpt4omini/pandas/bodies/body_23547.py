"""
    Load a parquet object from the file path, returning a DataFrame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str, path object or file-like object
        String, path object (implementing ``os.PathLike[str]``), or file-like
        object implementing a binary ``read()`` function.
        The string could be a URL. Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3,
        gs, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected. A local file could be:
        ``file://localhost/path/to/table.parquet``.
        A file URL can also be a path to a directory that contains multiple
        partitioned parquet files. Both pyarrow and fastparquet support
        paths to directories as well as file URLs. A directory path could be:
        ``file://localhost/path/to/tables`` or ``s3://bucket/partition_dir``.
    engine : {{'auto', 'pyarrow', 'fastparquet'}}, default 'auto'
        Parquet library to use. If 'auto', then the option
        ``io.parquet.engine`` is used. The default ``io.parquet.engine``
        behavior is to try 'pyarrow', falling back to 'fastparquet' if
        'pyarrow' is unavailable.
    columns : list, default=None
        If not None, only these columns will be read from the file.

    {storage_options}

        .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

    use_nullable_dtypes : bool, default False
        If True, use dtypes that use ``pd.NA`` as missing value indicator
        for the resulting DataFrame. (only applicable for the ``pyarrow``
        engine)
        As new dtypes are added that support ``pd.NA`` in the future, the
        output with this option will change to use those dtypes.
        Note: this is an experimental option, and behaviour (e.g. additional
        support dtypes) may change without notice.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

        The nullable dtype implementation can be configured by calling
        ``pd.set_option("mode.dtype_backend", "pandas")`` to use
        numpy-backed nullable dtypes or
        ``pd.set_option("mode.dtype_backend", "pyarrow")`` to use
        pyarrow-backed nullable dtypes (using ``pd.ArrowDtype``).

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    **kwargs
        Any additional kwargs are passed to the engine.

    Returns
