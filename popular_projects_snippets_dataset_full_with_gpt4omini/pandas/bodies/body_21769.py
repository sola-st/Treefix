"""
        Return a flattened view on this array.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : {None, 'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, default 'C'

        Returns
        -------
        ExtensionArray

        Notes
        -----
        - Because ExtensionArrays are 1D-only, this is a no-op.
        - The "order" argument is ignored, is for compatibility with NumPy.
