        Make a horizontal bar plot.

        A horizontal bar plot is a plot that presents quantitative data with
        rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they
        represent. A bar plot shows comparisons among discrete categories. One
        axis of the plot shows the specific categories being compared, and the
        other axis represents a measured value.
