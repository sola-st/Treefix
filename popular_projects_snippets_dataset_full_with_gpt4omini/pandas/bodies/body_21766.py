"""
        Formatting function for scalar values.

        This is used in the default '__repr__'. The returned formatting
        function receives instances of your scalar type.

        Parameters
        ----------
        boxed : bool, default False
            An indicated for whether or not your array is being printed
            within a Series, DataFrame, or Index (True), or just by
            itself (False). This may be useful if you want scalar values
            to appear differently within a Series versus on its own (e.g.
            quoted or not).

        Returns
        -------
        Callable[[Any], str]
            A callable that gets instances of the scalar type and
            returns a string. By default, :func:`repr` is used
            when ``boxed=False`` and :func:`str` is used when
            ``boxed=True``.
