"""
        Take elements from an array.

        Parameters
        ----------
        indices : sequence of int or one-dimensional np.ndarray of int
            Indices to be taken.
        allow_fill : bool, default False
            How to handle negative values in `indices`.

            * False: negative values in `indices` indicate positional indices
              from the right (the default). This is similar to
              :func:`numpy.take`.

            * True: negative values in `indices` indicate
              missing values. These values are set to `fill_value`. Any other
              other negative values raise a ``ValueError``.

        fill_value : any, optional
            Fill value to use for NA-indices when `allow_fill` is True.
            This may be ``None``, in which case the default NA value for
            the type, ``self.dtype.na_value``, is used.

            For many ExtensionArrays, there will be two representations of
            `fill_value`: a user-facing "boxed" scalar, and a low-level
            physical NA value. `fill_value` should be the user-facing version,
            and the implementation should handle translating that to the
            physical version for processing the take if necessary.

        Returns
        -------
        ExtensionArray

        Raises
        ------
        IndexError
            When the indices are out of bounds for the array.
        ValueError
            When `indices` contains negative values other than ``-1``
            and `allow_fill` is True.

        api.extensions.take : Take elements from an array.

        Notes
        -----
        ExtensionArray.take is called by ``Series.__getitem__``, ``.loc``,
        ``iloc``, when `indices` is a sequence of values. Additionally,
        it's called by :meth:`Series.reindex`, or any other method
        that causes realignment, with a `fill_value`.

        Examples
        --------
        Here's an example implementation, which relies on casting the
        extension array to object dtype. This uses the helper method
        :func:`pandas.api.extensions.take`.

        .. code-block:: python

           def take(self, indices, allow_fill=False, fill_value=None):
               from pandas.core.algorithms import take

               # If the ExtensionArray is backed by an ndarray, then
               # just pass that here instead of coercing to object.
               data = self.astype(object)

               if allow_fill and fill_value is None:
                   fill_value = self.dtype.na_value

               # fill value should always be translated from the scalar
               # type for the array, to the physical storage type for
               # the data, before passing to take.

               result = take(data, indices, fill_value=fill_value,
                             allow_fill=allow_fill)
               return self._from_sequence(result, dtype=self.dtype)
        """
# Implementer note: The `fill_value` parameter should be a user-facing
# value, an instance of self.dtype.type. When passed `fill_value=None`,
# the default of `self.dtype.na_value` should be used.
# This may differ from the physical storage type your ExtensionArray
# uses. In this case, your implementation is responsible for casting
# the user-facing type to the storage type, before using
# pandas.api.extensions.take
raise AbstractMethodError(self)
