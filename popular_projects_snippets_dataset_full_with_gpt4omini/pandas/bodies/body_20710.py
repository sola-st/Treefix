"""
        Make a copy of this object.

        Name is set on the new object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : Label, optional
            Set name for new object.
        deep : bool, default False

        Returns
        -------
        Index
            Index refer to new object which is a copy of this object.

        Notes
        -----
        In most cases, there should be no functional difference from using
        ``deep``, but if ``deep`` is passed it will attempt to deepcopy.
