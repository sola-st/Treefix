"""
    Calculate the second endpoint for passing to np.arange, checking
    to avoid an integer overflow.  Catch OverflowError and re-raise
    as OutOfBoundsDatetime.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endpoint : int
        nanosecond timestamp of the known endpoint of the desired range
    periods : int
        number of periods in the desired range
    stride : int
        nanoseconds between periods in the desired range
    side : {'start', 'end'}
        which end of the range `endpoint` refers to

    Returns
    -------
    other_end : int

    Raises
    ------
    OutOfBoundsDatetime
