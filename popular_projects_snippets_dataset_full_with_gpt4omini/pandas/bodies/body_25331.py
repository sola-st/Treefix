        Make a box plot of the DataFrame columns.

        A box plot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical
        data through their quartiles.
        The box extends from the Q1 to Q3 quartile values of the data,
        with a line at the median (Q2). The whiskers extend from the edges
        of box to show the range of the data. The position of the whiskers
        is set by default to 1.5*IQR (IQR = Q3 - Q1) from the edges of the
        box. Outlier points are those past the end of the whiskers.

        For further details see Wikipedia's
        entry for `boxplot <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot>`__.

        A consideration when using this chart is that the box and the whiskers
        can overlap, which is very common when plotting small sets of data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        by : str or sequence
            Column in the DataFrame to group by.

            .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0

               Previously, `by` is silently ignore and makes no groupings

        **kwargs
            Additional keywords are documented in
            :meth:`DataFrame.plot`.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`matplotlib.axes.Axes` or numpy.ndarray of them

        See Also
        --------
        DataFrame.boxplot: Another method to draw a box plot.
        Series.plot.box: Draw a box plot from a Series object.
        matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot: Draw a box plot in matplotlib.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw a box plot from a DataFrame with four columns of randomly
        generated data.

        .. plot::
            :context: close-figs

            >>> data = np.random.randn(25, 4)
            >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=list('ABCD'))
            >>> ax = df.plot.box()

        You can also generate groupings if you specify the `by` parameter (which
        can take a column name, or a list or tuple of column names):

        .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0

        .. plot::
            :context: close-figs

            >>> age_list = [8, 10, 12, 14, 72, 74, 76, 78, 20, 25, 30, 35, 60, 85]
            >>> df = pd.DataFrame({"gender": list("MMMMMMMMFFFFFF"), "age": age_list})
            >>> ax = df.plot.box(column="age", by="gender", figsize=(10, 8))
        """
exit(self(kind="box", by=by, **kwargs))
