""""""Raise :exc:`CannotSplit` if the last left- or right-hand split failed.

    Do nothing otherwise.

    A left- or right-hand split is based on a pair of brackets. Content before
    (and including) the opening bracket is left on one line, content inside the
    brackets is put on a separate line, and finally content starting with and
    following the closing bracket is put on a separate line.

    Those are called `head`, `body`, and `tail`, respectively. If the split
    produced the same line (all content in `head`) or ended up with an empty `body`
    and the `tail` is just the closing bracket, then it's considered failed.
