        Get a setting value as a dictionary. If the setting original type is a
        dictionary, a copy of it will be returned. If it is a string it will be
        evaluated as a JSON dictionary. In the case that it is a
        :class:`~scrapy.settings.BaseSettings` instance itself, it will be
        converted to a dictionary, containing all its current settings values
        as they would be returned by :meth:`~scrapy.settings.BaseSettings.get`,
        and losing all information about priority and mutability.
