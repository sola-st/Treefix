"""Returns the last snapshot of this variable.

    You usually do not need to call this method as all ops that need the value
    of the variable call it automatically through a `convert_to_tensor()` call.

    Returns a `Tensor` which holds the value of the variable.  You can not
    assign a new value to this tensor as it is not a reference to the variable.

    To avoid copies, if the consumer of the returned value is on the same device
    as the variable, this actually returns the live value of the variable, not
    a copy.  Updates to the variable are seen by the consumer.  If the consumer
    is on a different device it will get a copy of the variable.

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` containing the value of the variable.
