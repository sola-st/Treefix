"""Utility useful when changing a convnet's `data_format`.

  When porting the weights of a convnet from one data format to the other,
  if the convnet includes a `Flatten` layer
  (applied to the last convolutional feature map)
  followed by a `Dense` layer, the weights of that `Dense` layer
  should be updated to reflect the new dimension ordering.

  Args:
      dense: The target `Dense` layer.
      previous_feature_map_shape: A shape tuple of 3 integers,
          e.g. `(512, 7, 7)`. The shape of the convolutional
          feature map right before the `Flatten` layer that
          came before the target `Dense` layer.
      target_data_format: One of "channels_last", "channels_first".
          Set it "channels_last"
          if converting a "channels_first" model to "channels_last",
          or reciprocally.
