"""Annotate a Python source file with a list of ops created at each line.

  (The annotation doesn't change the source file itself.)

  Args:
    dump: (`DebugDumpDir`) A `DebugDumpDir` object of which the Python graph
      has been loaded.
    source_file_path: (`str`) Path to the source file being annotated.
    do_dumped_tensors: (`str`) Whether dumped Tensors, instead of ops are to be
      used to annotate the source file.
    file_stack_top: (`bool`) Whether only the top stack trace in the
      specified source file is to be annotated.
    min_line: (`None` or `int`) The 1-based line to start annotate the source
      file from (inclusive).
    max_line: (`None` or `int`) The 1-based line number to end the annotation
      at (exclusive).

  Returns:
    A `dict` mapping 1-based line number to a list of op name(s) created at
      that line, or tensor names if `do_dumped_tensors` is True.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the dump object does not have a Python graph set.
