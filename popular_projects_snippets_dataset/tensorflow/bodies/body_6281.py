"""Run `fn` once per replica.

    `fn` may call `tf.get_replica_context()` to access methods such as
    `replica_id_in_sync_group` and `merge_call()`.

    `merge_call()` is used to communicate between the replicas and
    re-enter the cross-replica context. All replicas pause their execution
    having encountered a `merge_call()` call. After that the
    `merge_fn`-function is executed. Its results are then unwrapped and
    given back to each replica call. After that execution resumes until
    `fn` is complete or encounters another `merge_call()`.  Example:

    ```python
    # Called once in "cross-replica" context.
    def merge_fn(distribution, three_plus_replica_id):
      # sum the values across replicas
      return sum(distribution.experimental_local_results(three_plus_replica_id))

    # Called once per replica in `distribution`, in a "replica" context.
    def fn(three):
      replica_ctx = tf.get_replica_context()
      v = three + replica_ctx.replica_id_in_sync_group
      # Computes the sum of the `v` values across all replicas.
      s = replica_ctx.merge_call(merge_fn, args=(v,))
      return s + v

    with distribution.scope():
      # in "cross-replica" context
      ...
      merged_results = distribution.run(fn, args=[3])
      # merged_results has the values from every replica execution of `fn`.
      # This statement prints a list:
      print(distribution.experimental_local_results(merged_results))
    ```

    Args:
      fn: function to run (will be run once per replica).
      args: Tuple or list with positional arguments for `fn`.
      kwargs: Dict with keyword arguments for `fn`.

    Returns:
      Merged return value of `fn` across all replicas.
