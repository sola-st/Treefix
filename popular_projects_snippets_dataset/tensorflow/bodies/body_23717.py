"""A dictionary with deferred dependencies.

    Stores restorations for other Trackable objects on which this object
    may eventually depend. May be overridden by sub-classes (e.g. Optimizers use
    conditional dependencies based the current graph, and so need separate
    management of deferred dependencies too).

    Returns:
      A dictionary mapping from local name to a list of CheckpointPosition
      objects.
