"""Get a dataset instance for the current DataAdapter.

    Note that the dataset returned does not repeat for epoch, so caller might
    need to create new iterator for the same dataset at the beginning of the
    epoch. This behavior might change in future.

    Returns:
      An tf.dataset.Dataset. Caller might use the dataset in different
      context, eg iter(dataset) in eager to get the value directly, or in graph
      mode, provide the iterator tensor to Keras model function.
