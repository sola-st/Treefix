"""Returns the default graph for the current thread.

  The returned graph will be the innermost graph on which a
  `Graph.as_default()` context has been entered, or a global default
  graph if none has been explicitly created.

  NOTE: The default graph is a property of the current thread. If you
  create a new thread, and wish to use the default graph in that
  thread, you must explicitly add a `with g.as_default():` in that
  thread's function.

  @compatibility(TF2)
  `get_default_graph` does not work with either eager execution or
  `tf.function`, and you should not invoke it directly. To migrate code that
  uses Graph-related functions to TF2, rewrite the code without them. See the
  [migration guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate) for more
  description about the behavior and semantic changes between Tensorflow 1 and
  Tensorflow 2.
  @end_compatibility

  Returns:
    The default `Graph` being used in the current thread.
