r"""Multiplies tridiagonal matrix by matrix.

  `diagonals` is representation of 3-diagonal NxN matrix, which depends on
  `diagonals_format`.

  In `matrix` format, `diagonals` must be a tensor of shape `[..., M, M]`, with
  two inner-most dimensions representing the square tridiagonal matrices.
  Elements outside of the three diagonals will be ignored.

  If `sequence` format, `diagonals` is list or tuple of three tensors:
  `[superdiag, maindiag, subdiag]`, each having shape [..., M]. Last element
  of `superdiag` first element of `subdiag` are ignored.

  In `compact` format the three diagonals are brought together into one tensor
  of shape `[..., 3, M]`, with last two dimensions containing superdiagonals,
  diagonals, and subdiagonals, in order. Similarly to `sequence` format,
  elements `diagonals[..., 0, M-1]` and `diagonals[..., 2, 0]` are ignored.

  The `sequence` format is recommended as the one with the best performance.

  `rhs` is matrix to the right of multiplication. It has shape `[..., M, N]`.

  Example:

  ```python
  superdiag = tf.constant([-1, -1, 0], dtype=tf.float64)
  maindiag = tf.constant([2, 2, 2], dtype=tf.float64)
  subdiag = tf.constant([0, -1, -1], dtype=tf.float64)
  diagonals = [superdiag, maindiag, subdiag]
  rhs = tf.constant([[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]], dtype=tf.float64)
  x = tf.linalg.tridiagonal_matmul(diagonals, rhs, diagonals_format='sequence')
  ```

  Args:
    diagonals: A `Tensor` or tuple of `Tensor`s describing left-hand sides. The
      shape depends of `diagonals_format`, see description above. Must be
      `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, or `complex128`.
    rhs: A `Tensor` of shape [..., M, N] and with the same dtype as `diagonals`.
    diagonals_format: one of `sequence`, or `compact`. Default is `compact`.
    name:  A name to give this `Op` (optional).

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of shape [..., M, N] containing the result of multiplication.

  Raises:
    ValueError: An unsupported type is provided as input, or when the input
    tensors have incorrect shapes.
