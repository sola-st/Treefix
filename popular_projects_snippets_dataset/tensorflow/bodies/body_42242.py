"""Add a post-op callback to the context.

    A post-op callback is invoked immediately after an eager operation or
    function has finished execution or after a op has been added to a graph,
    providing access to the op's type, name input and output tensors. Multiple
    op callbacks can be added, in which case the callbacks will be invoked in
    the order in which they are added.

    Args:
      callback: a callable of the signature `f(op_type, inputs, attrs, outputs,
        op_name=None, graph=None)`. See doc strings in `op_callbacks.py` for
        details on the function signature and its semantics.
