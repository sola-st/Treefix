"""The transpose of `conv2d`.

  This operation is sometimes called "deconvolution" after
  (Zeiler et al., 2010), but is really the transpose (gradient) of `conv2d`
  rather than an actual deconvolution.

  Args:
    value: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float` and shape
      `[batch, height, width, in_channels]` for `NHWC` data format or
      `[batch, in_channels, height, width]` for `NCHW` data format.
    filter: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape
      `[height, width, output_channels, in_channels]`.  `filter`'s
      `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`.
    output_shape: A 1-D `Tensor` representing the output shape of the
      deconvolution op.
    strides: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`.  The
      stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single
      value is given it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By default
      the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 0. The dimension order is determined
      by the value of `data_format`, see below for details.
    padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm.
      See the "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.
    data_format: A string. 'NHWC' and 'NCHW' are supported.
    name: Optional name for the returned tensor.
    input: Alias for value.
    filters: Alias for filter.
    dilations: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `2` or `4`,
      defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a
      single value is given it is replicated in the `H` and `W` dimension. By
      default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there
      will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension.
      The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see above
      for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a 4-d tensor
      must be 1.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filter`'s shape, or if
      padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.
