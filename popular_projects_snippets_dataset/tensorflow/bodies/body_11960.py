"""Looks up embeddings for the given `ids` from a list of tensors.

  This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of tensors in
  `params`.  It is a generalization of `tf.gather`, where `params` is
  interpreted as a partitioning of a large embedding tensor.  `params` may be
  a `PartitionedVariable` as returned by using `tf.compat.v1.get_variable()`
  with a partitioner.

  If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between
  the elements of `params` according to the `partition_strategy`.
  In all strategies, if the id space does not evenly divide the number of
  partitions, each of the first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will
  be assigned one more id.

  If `partition_strategy` is `"mod"`, we assign each id to partition
  `p = id % len(params)`. For instance,
  13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
  `[[0, 5, 10], [1, 6, 11], [2, 7, 12], [3, 8], [4, 9]]`

  If `partition_strategy` is `"div"`, we assign ids to partitions in a
  contiguous manner. In this case, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
  `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`

  If the input ids are ragged tensors, partition variables are not supported and
  the partition strategy and the max_norm are ignored.
  The results of the lookup are concatenated into a dense
  tensor. The returned tensor has shape `shape(ids) + shape(params)[1:]`.

  Args:
    params: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a
      list of P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension,
      representing sharded embedding tensors.  Alternatively, a
      `PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning along dimension 0. Each
      element must be appropriately sized for the given `partition_strategy`.
    ids: A `Tensor` or a 'RaggedTensor' with type `int32` or `int64` containing
      the ids to be looked up in `params`.
    partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
      if `len(params) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default
      is `"mod"`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).
    validate_indices: DEPRECATED. If this operation is assigned to CPU, values
      in `indices` are always validated to be within range.  If assigned to GPU,
      out-of-bound indices result in safe but unspecified behavior, which may
      include raising an error.
    max_norm: If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger
      than this value.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` or a 'RaggedTensor', depending on the input, with the same type
    as the tensors in `params`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `params` is empty.
