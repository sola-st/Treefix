"""Flattens `input_tree` up to `shallow_tree`.

  Refer to [tf.nest](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nest)
  for the definition of a structure.

  Any further depth in structure in `input_tree` is retained as structures in
  the partially flatten output.

  If `shallow_tree` and `input_tree` are atoms, this returns a
  single-item list: `[input_tree]`.

  Use Case:

  Sometimes we may wish to partially flatten a structure, retaining some
  of the nested structure. We achieve this by specifying a shallow structure,
  `shallow_tree`, we wish to flatten up to.

  The input, `input_tree`, can be thought of as having the same structure layout
  as `shallow_tree`, but with leaf nodes that are themselves tree structures.

  Examples:

  ```python
  input_tree = [[[2, 2], [3, 3]], [[4, 9], [5, 5]]]
  shallow_tree = [[True, True], [False, True]]

  flattened_input_tree = flatten_up_to(shallow_tree, input_tree)
  flattened_shallow_tree = flatten_up_to(shallow_tree, shallow_tree)

  # Output is:
  # [[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 9], [5, 5]]
  # [True, True, False, True]
  ```

  ```python
  input_tree = [[('a', 1), [('b', 2), [('c', 3), [('d', 4)]]]]]
  shallow_tree = [['level_1', ['level_2', ['level_3', ['level_4']]]]]

  input_tree_flattened_as_shallow_tree = flatten_up_to(shallow_tree, input_tree)
  input_tree_flattened = flatten(input_tree)

  # Output is:
  # [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)]
  # ['a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', 3, 'd', 4]
  ```

  Edge Cases for atoms:

  ```python
  flatten_up_to(0, 0)  # Output: [0]
  flatten_up_to(0, [0, 1, 2])  # Output: [[0, 1, 2]]
  flatten_up_to([0, 1, 2], 0)  # Output: TypeError
  flatten_up_to([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2])  # Output: [0, 1, 2]
  ```

  Args:
    shallow_tree: a possibly pruned structure of input_tree.
    input_tree: an atom or a nested structure.
      Note, numpy arrays are considered atoms.
    check_types: bool. If True, check that each node in shallow_tree has the
      same type as the corresponding node in input_tree.
    expand_composites: If true, then composite tensors such as
      `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` and `tf.RaggedTensor` are expanded into their
      component tensors.

  Returns:
    A Python list, the partially flattened version of `input_tree` according to
    the structure of `shallow_tree`.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If `shallow_tree` is a nested structure but `input_tree` is not.
    TypeError: If the structure types of `shallow_tree` are different from
      `input_tree`.
    ValueError: If the structure lengths of `shallow_tree` are different from
      `input_tree`.
