"""Validates whether the trackable can be restored with the saver.

  When using a checkpoint saved with a registered saver, that same saver must
  also be also registered when loading. The name of that saver is saved to the
  checkpoint and set in the `registered_name` arg.

  Args:
    trackable: A `Trackable` object.
    registered_name: String name of the expected registered saver. This argument
      should be set using the name saved in a checkpoint.

  Raises:
    ValueError if the saver could not be found, or if the predicate associated
      with the saver does not pass.
