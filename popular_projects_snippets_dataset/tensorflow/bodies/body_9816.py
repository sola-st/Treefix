"""Resets resource containers on `target`, and close all connected sessions.

    A resource container is distributed across all workers in the
    same cluster as `target`.  When a resource container on `target`
    is reset, resources associated with that container will be cleared.
    In particular, all Variables in the container will become undefined:
    they lose their values and shapes.

    NOTE:
    (i) reset() is currently only implemented for distributed sessions.
    (ii) Any sessions on the master named by `target` will be closed.

    If no resource containers are provided, all containers are reset.

    Args:
      target: The execution engine to connect to.
      containers: A list of resource container name strings, or `None` if all of
        all the containers are to be reset.
      config: (Optional.) Protocol buffer with configuration options.

    Raises:
      tf.errors.OpError: Or one of its subclasses if an error occurs while
        resetting containers.
