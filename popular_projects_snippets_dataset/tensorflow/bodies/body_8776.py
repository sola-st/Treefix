"""Wait for the result of `RemoteValue` and return the numpy result.

    This makes the value concrete by copying the remote value to local.

    Returns:
      The numpy array structure of the actual output of the `tf.function`
      associated with this `RemoteValue`, previously returned by a
      `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator.schedule` call.
      This can be a single value, or a structure of values, depending on the
      output of the `tf.function`.

    Raises:
      tf.errors.CancelledError: If the function that produces this `RemoteValue`
        is aborted or cancelled due to failure.
