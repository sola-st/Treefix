"""Wrapper for `Graph.get_collection_ref()` using the default graph.

  See `tf.Graph.get_collection_ref`
  for more details.

  Args:
    key: The key for the collection. For example, the `GraphKeys` class contains
      many standard names for collections.

  Returns:
    The list of values in the collection with the given `name`, or an empty
    list if no value has been added to that collection.  Note that this returns
    the collection list itself, which can be modified in place to change the
    collection.

  @compatibility(eager)
  Collections are not supported when eager execution is enabled.
