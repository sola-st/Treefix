"""Returns an IdWeightPair.

    `IdWeightPair` is a pair of `SparseTensor`s which represents ids and
    weights.

    `IdWeightPair.id_tensor` is typically a `batch_size` x `num_buckets`
    `SparseTensor` of `int64`. `IdWeightPair.weight_tensor` is either a
    `SparseTensor` of `float` or `None` to indicate all weights should be
    taken to be 1. If specified, `weight_tensor` must have exactly the same
    shape and indices as `sp_ids`. Expected `SparseTensor` is same as parsing
    output of a `VarLenFeature` which is a ragged matrix.

    Args:
      inputs: A `LazyBuilder` as a cache to get input tensors required to create
        `IdWeightPair`.
      weight_collections: List of graph collections to which variables (if any
        will be created) are added.
      trainable: If `True` also add variables to the graph collection
        `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see `tf.compat.v1.get_variable`).
