"""Walk a Graph and capture the subgraph between init_tensor and sources.

  Note: This function mutates visited_ops and op_outputs.

  Args:
    init_tensor:  A Tensor or Operation where the subgraph terminates.
    sources:  A set of Tensors where subgraph extraction should stop.
    disallowed_placeholders: An optional set of ops which may not appear in the
      lifted graph. Defaults to all placeholders.
    visited_ops: A set of operations which were visited in a prior pass.
    op_outputs: A defaultdict containing the outputs of an op which are to be
      copied into the new subgraph.
    add_sources: A boolean indicating whether placeholders which are not in
      sources should be allowed.

  Returns:
    The set of placeholders upon which init_tensor depends and are not in
    sources.

  Raises:
    UnliftableError: if init_tensor depends on a placeholder which is not in
      sources and add_sources is False.
