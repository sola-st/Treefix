r"""Computes the sum along sparse segments of a tensor divided by the sqrt(N).

  Read [the section on
  segmentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math#about_segmentation)
  for an explanation of segments.

  Like `tf.sparse.segment_mean`, but instead of dividing by the size of the
  segment, `N`, divide by `sqrt(N)` instead.

  Args:
    data: A `Tensor` with data that will be assembled in the output.
    indices: A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into `data`. Has same rank as
      `segment_ids`.
    segment_ids: A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into the output `Tensor`. Values
      should be sorted and can be repeated.
    num_segments: An optional int32 scalar. Indicates the size of the output
      `Tensor`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A `tensor` of the shape as data, except for dimension 0 which
    has size `k`, the number of segments specified via `num_segments` or
    inferred for the last element in `segments_ids`.
