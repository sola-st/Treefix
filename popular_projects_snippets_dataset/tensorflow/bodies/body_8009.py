"""Validates `cluster_spec`.

  It checks:
  1) task type is one of "chief", "worker", "ps", "evaluator", or not provided
     (None).
  2) whether there is such a task type as `task_type` in the `cluster_spec`. The
     only exception is `evaluator`. In other words, it is still a valid
     configuration when `task_type` is `evaluator` but it doesn't appear in
     `cluster_spec`. This is to be compatible with `TF_CONFIG` in Estimator.
  3) whether there is at most one "chief" job.
  4) whether there is at most one "evaluator" job.
  5) whether the `task_id` is smaller than the number of tasks for that
     particular `task_type`.

  Args:
    cluster_spec: a dict, `ClusterDef` or `ClusterSpec` object to be validated.
    task_type: string indicating the type of the task.
    task_id: the id of the `task_type` in this cluster.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if `cluster_spec` fails any check.
