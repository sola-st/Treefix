"""Creates a new `Session` and waits for model to be ready.

    Creates a new `Session` on 'master'.  Waits for the model to be
    initialized or recovered from a checkpoint.  It's expected that
    another thread or process will make the model ready, and that this
    is intended to be used by threads/processes that participate in a
    distributed training configuration where a different thread/process
    is responsible for initializing or recovering the model being trained.

    NB: The amount of time this method waits for the session is bounded
    by max_wait_secs. By default, this function will wait indefinitely.

    Args:
      master: `String` representation of the TensorFlow master to use.
      config: Optional ConfigProto proto used to configure the session.
      max_wait_secs: Maximum time to wait for the session to become available.

    Returns:
      A `Session`. May be None if the operation exceeds the timeout
      specified by config.operation_timeout_in_ms.

    Raises:
      tf.DeadlineExceededError: if the session is not available after
        max_wait_secs.
