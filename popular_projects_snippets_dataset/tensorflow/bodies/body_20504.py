"""Shards `computation` along the batch dimension for parallel execution.

  Convenience wrapper around shard().

  `inputs` must be a list of Tensors or None (equivalent to an empty list).
  Each input is split into `num_shards` pieces along the 0-th dimension, and
  computation is applied to each shard in parallel.

  Tensors are broadcast to all shards if they are lexically captured by
  `computation`. e.g.,

  x = tf.constant(7)
  def computation():
    return x + 3
  ... = shard(computation, ...)

  The outputs from all shards are concatenated back together along their 0-th
  dimension.

  Inputs and outputs of the computation must be at least rank-1 Tensors.

  Args:
    computation: A Python function that builds a computation to apply to each
      shard of the input.
    inputs: A list of input tensors or None (equivalent to an empty list). The
      0-th dimension of each Tensor must have size divisible by `num_shards`.
    num_shards: The number of shards.
    infeed_queue: If not `None`, the `InfeedQueue` from which to append a tuple
      of arguments as inputs to `computation`.
    device_assignment: If not `None`, a `DeviceAssignment` describing the
      mapping between logical cores in the computation with physical cores in
      the TPU topology. Uses a default device assignment if `None`. The
      `DeviceAssignment` may be omitted if each shard of the computation uses
      only one core, and there is either only one shard, or the number of shards
      is equal to the number of cores in the TPU system.
    name: (Deprecated) Does nothing.
    xla_options: An instance of `tpu.XLAOptions` which indicates the options
      passed to XLA compiler. Use `None` for default options.
  Returns:
    A list of output tensors.
  Raises:
    ValueError: If `num_shards <= 0`
