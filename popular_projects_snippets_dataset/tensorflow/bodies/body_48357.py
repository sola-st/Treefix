"""Retrieves the input shape(s) of a layer.

    Only applicable if the layer has exactly one input,
    i.e. if it is connected to one incoming layer, or if all inputs
    have the same shape.

    Returns:
        Input shape, as an integer shape tuple
        (or list of shape tuples, one tuple per input tensor).

    Raises:
        AttributeError: if the layer has no defined input_shape.
        RuntimeError: if called in Eager mode.
