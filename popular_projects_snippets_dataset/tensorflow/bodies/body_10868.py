"""Generate a training graph for kmeans algorithm.

    This returns, among other things, an op that chooses initial centers
    (init_op), a boolean variable that is set to True when the initial centers
    are chosen (cluster_centers_initialized), and an op to perform either an
    entire Lloyd iteration or a mini-batch of a Lloyd iteration (training_op).
    The caller should use these components as follows. A single worker should
    execute init_op multiple times until cluster_centers_initialized becomes
    True. Then multiple workers may execute training_op any number of times.

    Returns:
      A tuple consisting of:
      all_scores: A matrix (or list of matrices) of dimensions (num_input,
        num_clusters) where the value is the distance of an input vector and a
        cluster center.
      cluster_idx: A vector (or list of vectors). Each element in the vector
        corresponds to an input row in 'inp' and specifies the cluster id
        corresponding to the input.
      scores: Similar to cluster_idx but specifies the distance to the
        assigned cluster instead.
      cluster_centers_initialized: scalar indicating whether clusters have been
        initialized.
      init_op: an op to initialize the clusters.
      training_op: an op that runs an iteration of training.
