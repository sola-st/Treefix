"""Updates this variable with the max of `tf.IndexedSlices` and itself.

    `ref` is a `Tensor` with rank `P` and `indices` is a `Tensor` of rank `Q`.

    `indices` must be integer tensor, containing indices into `ref`.
    It must be shape `[d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, K]` where `0 < K <= P`.

    The innermost dimension of `indices` (with length `K`) corresponds to
    indices into elements (if `K = P`) or slices (if `K < P`) along the `K`th
    dimension of `ref`.

    `updates` is `Tensor` of rank `Q-1+P-K` with shape:

    ```
    [d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, ref.shape[K], ..., ref.shape[P-1]].
    ```

    See `tf.scatter_nd` for more details about how to make updates to
    slices.

    Args:
      indices: The indices to be used in the operation.
      updates: The values to be used in the operation.
      name: the name of the operation.

    Returns:
      A `Tensor` that will hold the new value of this variable after
      the scattered addition has completed.
