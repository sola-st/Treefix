        The metadata for the data frame, as a dictionary with string keys. The
        contents of `metadata` may be anything, they are meant for a library
        to store information that it needs to, e.g., roundtrip losslessly or
        for two implementations to share data that is not (yet) part of the
        interchange protocol specification. For avoiding collisions with other
        entries, please add name the keys with the name of the library
        followed by a period and the desired name, e.g, ``pandas.indexcol``.
