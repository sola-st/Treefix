# ExtensionArray-safe unstack.
# We override ObjectBlock._unstack, which unstacks directly on the
# values of the array. For EA-backed blocks, this would require
# converting to a 2-D ndarray of objects.
# Instead, we unstack an ndarray of integer positions, followed by
# a `take` on the actual values.

# Caller is responsible for ensuring self.shape[-1] == len(unstacker.index)
new_values, mask = unstacker.arange_result

# Note: these next two lines ensure that
#  mask.sum() == sum(len(nb.mgr_locs) for nb in blocks)
#  which the calling function needs in order to pass verify_integrity=False
#  to the BlockManager constructor
new_values = new_values.T[mask]
new_placement = new_placement[mask]

# needs_masking[i] calculated once in BlockManager.unstack tells
#  us if there are any -1s in the relevant indices.  When False,
#  that allows us to go through a faster path in 'take', among
#  other things avoiding e.g. Categorical._validate_scalar.
blocks = [
    # TODO: could cast to object depending on fill_value?
    type(self)(
        self.values.take(
            indices, allow_fill=needs_masking[i], fill_value=fill_value
        ),
        BlockPlacement(place),
        ndim=2,
    )
    for i, (indices, place) in enumerate(zip(new_values, new_placement))
]
