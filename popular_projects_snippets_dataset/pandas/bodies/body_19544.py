"""
        Iterate over blocks applying quantile reduction.
        This routine is intended for reduction type operations and
        will do inference on the generated blocks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis: reduction axis, default 0
        consolidate: bool, default True. Join together blocks having same
            dtype
        interpolation : type of interpolation, default 'linear'
        qs : list of the quantiles to be computed

        Returns
        -------
        BlockManager
        """
# Series dispatches to DataFrame for quantile, which allows us to
#  simplify some of the code here and in the blocks

assert is_list_like(qs)  # caller is responsible for this
assert axis == 1  # only ever called this way

new_axes = list(self.axes)
