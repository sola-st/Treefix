        Concatenate multiple array of this dtype.

        Parameters

        to_concat : sequence of this type

        Returns

# Implementer note: this method will only be called with a sequence of
# ExtensionArrays of this class and with the same dtype as self. This
# should allow "easy" concatenation (no upcasting needed), and result
# in a new ExtensionArray of the same dtype.
# Note: this strict behaviour is only guaranteed starting with pandas 1.1
