"""
        Find all occurrences of pattern or regular expression in the Series/Index.

        Equivalent to applying :func:`re.findall` to all the elements in the
        Series/Index.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pat : str
            Pattern or regular expression.
        flags : int, default 0
            Flags from ``re`` module, e.g. `re.IGNORECASE` (default is 0, which
            means no flags).

        Returns
        -------
        Series/Index of lists of strings
            All non-overlapping matches of pattern or regular expression in each
            string of this Series/Index.

        See Also
        --------
        count : Count occurrences of pattern or regular expression in each string
            of the Series/Index.
        extractall : For each string in the Series, extract groups from all matches
            of regular expression and return a DataFrame with one row for each
            match and one column for each group.
        re.findall : The equivalent ``re`` function to all non-overlapping matches
            of pattern or regular expression in string, as a list of strings.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = pd.Series(['Lion', 'Monkey', 'Rabbit'])

        The search for the pattern 'Monkey' returns one match:

        >>> s.str.findall('Monkey')
        0          []
        1    [Monkey]
        2          []
        dtype: object

        On the other hand, the search for the pattern 'MONKEY' doesn't return any
        match:

        >>> s.str.findall('MONKEY')
        0    []
        1    []
        2    []
        dtype: object

        Flags can be added to the pattern or regular expression. For instance,
        to find the pattern 'MONKEY' ignoring the case:

        >>> import re
        >>> s.str.findall('MONKEY', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
        0          []
        1    [Monkey]
        2          []
        dtype: object

        When the pattern matches more than one string in the Series, all matches
        are returned:

        >>> s.str.findall('on')
        0    [on]
        1    [on]
        2      []
        dtype: object

        Regular expressions are supported too. For instance, the search for all the
        strings ending with the word 'on' is shown next:

        >>> s.str.findall('on$')
        0    [on]
        1      []
        2      []
        dtype: object

        If the pattern is found more than once in the same string, then a list of
        multiple strings is returned:

        >>> s.str.findall('b')
        0        []
        1        []
        2    [b, b]
        dtype: object
        """
result = self._data.array._str_findall(pat, flags)
exit(self._wrap_result(result, returns_string=False))
