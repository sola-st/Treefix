"""
    For the apply-type methods, ``axis=None`` creates ``data`` as DataFrame, and for
    ``axis=[1,0]`` it creates a Series. Where ``arg`` is expected as an element
    of some operator with ``data`` we must make sure that the two are compatible shapes,
    or raise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg : sequence, Series or DataFrame
        the user input arg
    arg_name : string
        name of the arg for use in error messages
    dtype : numpy dtype, optional
        forced numpy dtype if given
    data : Series or DataFrame
        underling subset of Styler data on which operations are performed

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
