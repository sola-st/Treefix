"""
    Justify items in head and tail, so they are right-aligned when stacked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    head : list-like of list-likes of strings
    tail : list-like of list-likes of strings

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of list of tuples of strings
        Same as head and tail, but items are right aligned when stacked
        vertically.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> _justify([['a', 'b']], [['abc', 'abcd']])
    ([('  a', '   b')], [('abc', 'abcd')])
