"""
    Helper method for our assert_* methods that ensures that
    the two objects being compared have the right type before
    proceeding with the comparison.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : The first object being compared.
    right : The second object being compared.
    cls : The class type to check against.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError : Either `left` or `right` is not an instance of `cls`.
