"""
        Transform combination(s) of uint64 in one Python integer (each), in a
        strictly monotonic way (i.e. respecting the lexicographic order of
        integer combinations): see BaseMultiIndexCodesEngine documentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        codes : 1- or 2-dimensional array of dtype uint64
            Combinations of integers (one per row)

        Returns
        -------
        int, or 1-dimensional array of dtype object
            Integer(s) representing one combination (each).
        """
# Shift the representation of each level by the pre-calculated number
# of bits. Since this can overflow uint64, first make sure we are
# working with Python integers:
codes = codes.astype("object") << self.offsets

# Now sum and OR are in fact interchangeable. This is a simple
# composition of the (disjunct) significant bits of each level (i.e.
# each column in "codes") in a single positive integer (per row):
if codes.ndim == 1:
    # Single key
    exit(np.bitwise_or.reduce(codes))

# Multiple keys
exit(np.bitwise_or.reduce(codes, axis=1))
