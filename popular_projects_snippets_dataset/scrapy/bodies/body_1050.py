"""
        Process a request received by the engine.

        Return ``True`` if the request is stored correctly, ``False`` otherwise.

        If ``False``, the engine will fire a ``request_dropped`` signal, and
        will not make further attempts to schedule the request at a later time.
        For reference, the default Scrapy scheduler returns ``False`` when the
        request is rejected by the dupefilter.
