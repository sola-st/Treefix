"""Creates a test client for this application.  For information
        about unit testing head over to :doc:`/testing`.

        Note that if you are testing for assertions or exceptions in your
        application code, you must set ``app.testing = True`` in order for the
        exceptions to propagate to the test client.  Otherwise, the exception
        will be handled by the application (not visible to the test client) and
        the only indication of an AssertionError or other exception will be a
        500 status code response to the test client.  See the :attr:`testing`
        attribute.  For example::

            app.testing = True
            client = app.test_client()

        The test client can be used in a ``with`` block to defer the closing down
        of the context until the end of the ``with`` block.  This is useful if
        you want to access the context locals for testing::

            with app.test_client() as c:
                rv = c.get('/?vodka=42')
                assert request.args['vodka'] == '42'

        Additionally, you may pass optional keyword arguments that will then
        be passed to the application's :attr:`test_client_class` constructor.
        For example::

            from flask.testing import FlaskClient

            class CustomClient(FlaskClient):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    self._authentication = kwargs.pop("authentication")
                    super(CustomClient,self).__init__( *args, **kwargs)

            app.test_client_class = CustomClient
            client = app.test_client(authentication='Basic ....')

        See :class:`~flask.testing.FlaskClient` for more information.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.4
           added support for ``with`` block usage for the client.

        .. versionadded:: 0.7
           The `use_cookies` parameter was added as well as the ability
           to override the client to be used by setting the
           :attr:`test_client_class` attribute.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.11
           Added `**kwargs` to support passing additional keyword arguments to
           the constructor of :attr:`test_client_class`.
