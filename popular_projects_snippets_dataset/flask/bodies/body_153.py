"""Create an :class:`~flask.ctx.AppContext`. Use as a ``with``
        block to push the context, which will make :data:`current_app`
        point at this application.

        An application context is automatically pushed by
        :meth:`RequestContext.push() <flask.ctx.RequestContext.push>`
        when handling a request, and when running a CLI command. Use
        this to manually create a context outside of these situations.

        ::

            with app.app_context():
                init_db()

        See :doc:`/appcontext`.
