    Append leaves (taken from @old_line) to @new_line, making sure to fix the
    underlying Node structure where appropriate.

    All of the leaves in @leaves are duplicated. The duplicates are then
    appended to @new_line and used to replace their originals in the underlying
    Node structure. Any comments attached to the old leaves are reattached to
    the new leaves.

    Pre-conditions:
        set(@leaves) is a subset of set(@old_line.leaves).
