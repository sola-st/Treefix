        This method contains the algorithm that StringSplitter uses to
        determine which character to split each string at.

        Args:
            @string: The substring that we are attempting to split.
            @max_break_idx: The ideal break index. We will return this value if it
            meets all the necessary conditions. In the likely event that it
            doesn't we will try to find the closest index BELOW @max_break_idx
            that does. If that fails, we will expand our search by also
            considering all valid indices ABOVE @max_break_idx.

        Pre-Conditions:
            * assert_is_leaf_string(@string)
            * 0 <= @max_break_idx < len(@string)

        Returns:
            break_idx, if an index is able to be found that meets all of the
            conditions listed in the 'Transformations' section of this classes'
            docstring.
                OR
            None, otherwise.
