        Called when a spider gets idle, i.e. when there are no remaining requests to download or schedule.
        It can be called multiple times. If a handler for the spider_idle signal raises a DontCloseSpider
        exception, the spider is not closed until the next loop and this function is guaranteed to be called
        (at least) once again. A handler can raise CloseSpider to provide a custom closing reason.
