"""Creates a `Session`. Makes sure the model is ready to be used.

    Creates a `Session` on 'master'. If a `saver` object is passed in, and
    `checkpoint_dir` points to a directory containing valid checkpoint
    files, then it will try to recover the model from checkpoint. If
    no checkpoint files are available, and `wait_for_checkpoint` is
    `True`, then the process would check every `recovery_wait_secs`,
    up to `max_wait_secs`, for recovery to succeed.

    If the model cannot be recovered successfully then it is initialized by
    running the `init_op` and calling `init_fn` if they are provided.
    The `local_init_op` is also run after init_op and init_fn, regardless of
    whether the model was recovered successfully, but only if
    `ready_for_local_init_op` passes.

    If the model is recovered from a checkpoint it is assumed that all
    global variables have been initialized, in particular neither `init_op`
    nor `init_fn` will be executed.

    It is an error if the model cannot be recovered and no `init_op`
    or `init_fn` or `local_init_op` are passed.

    Args:
      master: `String` representation of the TensorFlow master to use.
      init_op: Optional `Operation` used to initialize the model.
      saver: A `Saver` object used to restore a model.
      checkpoint_dir: Path to the checkpoint files. The latest checkpoint in the
        dir will be used to restore.
      checkpoint_filename_with_path: Full file name path to the checkpoint file.
      wait_for_checkpoint: Whether to wait for checkpoint to become available.
      max_wait_secs: Maximum time to wait for checkpoints to become available.
      config: Optional `ConfigProto` proto used to configure the session.
      init_feed_dict: Optional dictionary that maps `Tensor` objects to feed
        values.  This feed dictionary is passed to the session `run()` call when
        running the init op.
      init_fn: Optional callable used to initialize the model. Called after the
        optional `init_op` is called.  The callable must accept one argument,
        the session being initialized.

    Returns:
      A `Session` object that can be used to drive the model.

    Raises:
      RuntimeError: If the model cannot be initialized or recovered.
      ValueError: If both checkpoint_dir and checkpoint_filename_with_path are
        set.
