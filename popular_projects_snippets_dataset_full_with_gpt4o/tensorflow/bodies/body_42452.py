    logdir: Path of TensorBoard log directory e.g. /tmp/tb_log.
    duration_ms: Duration of tracing or monitoring in ms.
    worker_list: The list of worker TPUs that we are about to profile in the
      current session. (TPU only)
    include_dataset_ops: Set to false to profile longer traces.
    num_tracing_attempts: Automatically retry N times when no trace event is
      collected.
