"""Extended timestamp, possibly with an index suffix.

    The index suffix, e.g., "-1", is for disambiguating multiple dumps of the
    same tensor with the same timestamp, which can occur if the dumping events
    are spaced by shorter than the temporal resolution of the timestamps.

    Returns:
      (`str`) The extended timestamp.
