"""Computes log(sum(exp(elements across dimensions of a tensor))).

  This function is more numerically stable than log(sum(exp(x))).
  It avoids overflows caused by taking the exp of large inputs and
  underflows caused by taking the log of small inputs.

  Args:
      x: A tensor or variable.
      axis: An integer, the axis to reduce over.
      keepdims: A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not.
          If `keepdims` is `False`, the rank of the tensor is reduced
          by 1. If `keepdims` is `True`, the reduced dimension is
          retained with length 1.

  Returns:
      The reduced tensor.
