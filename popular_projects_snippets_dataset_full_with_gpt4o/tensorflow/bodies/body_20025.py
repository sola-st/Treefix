"""Optimization parameters for momentum.

    Args:
      learning_rate: a floating point value. The learning rate.
      momentum: a floating point value.  The momentum.
      use_nesterov: If `True` use Nesterov Momentum. See (Sutskever et al.,
        2013). This implementation always computes gradients at the value of the
        variable(s) passed to the optimizer. Using Nesterov Momentum makes the
        variable(s) track the values called `theta_t + mu*v_t` in the paper.
        This implementation is an approximation of the original formula, valid
        for high values of momentum. It will compute the "adjusted gradient" in
        NAG by assuming that the new gradient will be estimated by the current
        average gradient plus the product of momentum and the change in the
        average gradient.
      use_gradient_accumulation: setting this to `False` makes embedding
        gradients calculation less accurate but faster. Please see
        `optimization_parameters.proto` for details.
      clip_weight_min: the minimum value to clip by; None means -infinity.
      clip_weight_max: the maximum value to clip by; None means +infinity.
      weight_decay_factor: amount of weight decay to apply; None means that the
        weights are not decayed.
      multiply_weight_decay_factor_by_learning_rate: if true,
        `weight_decay_factor` is multiplied by the current learning rate.
      clip_gradient_min: the minimum value to clip by; None means -infinity.
        Gradient accumulation must be set to true if this is set.
      clip_gradient_max: the maximum value to clip by; None means +infinity.
        Gradient accumulation must be set to true if this is set.
