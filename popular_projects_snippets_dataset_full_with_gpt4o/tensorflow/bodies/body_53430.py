"""Code locations for device context managers active at op creation.

    This property will return a list of traceable_stack.TraceableObject
    instances where .obj is a string representing the assigned device
    (or information about the function that would be applied to this op
    to compute the desired device) and the filename and lineno members
    record the location of the relevant device context manager.

    For example, suppose file_a contained these lines:

      file_a.py:
        15: with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
        16:   node_b = tf.constant(4, name='NODE_B')

    Then a TraceableObject t_obj representing the device context manager
    would have these member values:

      t_obj.obj -> '/gpu:0'
      t_obj.filename = 'file_a.py'
      t_obj.lineno = 15

    and node_b.op._device_assignments would return the list [t_obj].

    Returns:
      [str: traceable_stack.TraceableObject, ...] as per this method's
      description, above.
