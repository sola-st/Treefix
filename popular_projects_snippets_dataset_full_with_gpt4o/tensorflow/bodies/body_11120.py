"""Resizes and pads an image to a target width and height.

  Resizes an image to a target width and height by keeping
  the aspect ratio the same without distortion. If the target
  dimensions don't match the image dimensions, the image
  is resized and then padded with zeroes to match requested
  dimensions.

  Args:
    image: 4-D Tensor of shape `[batch, height, width, channels]` or 3-D Tensor
      of shape `[height, width, channels]`.
    target_height: Target height.
    target_width: Target width.
    method: Method to use for resizing image. See `image.resize()`
    antialias: Whether to use anti-aliasing when resizing. See 'image.resize()'.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if `target_height` or `target_width` are zero or negative.

  Returns:
    Resized and padded image.
    If `images` was 4-D, a 4-D float Tensor of shape
    `[batch, new_height, new_width, channels]`.
    If `images` was 3-D, a 3-D float Tensor of shape
    `[new_height, new_width, channels]`.
