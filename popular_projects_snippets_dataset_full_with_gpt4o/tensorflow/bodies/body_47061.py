"""Unscales the gradients by the loss scale.

    This method is only needed if you compute gradients manually, e.g. with
    `tf.GradientTape`. In that case, call this method to unscale the gradients
    after computing them with `tf.GradientTape`. If you use
    `LossScaleOptimizer.minimize` or `LossScaleOptimizer.get_gradients`, loss
    scaling is automatically applied and this method is unneeded.

    If this method is called, `get_scaled_loss` should also be called. See
    the `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer` doc for an
    example.

    Args:
      grads: A list of tensors, each which will be divided by the loss scale.
        Can have None values, which are ignored.

    Returns:
      A new list the same size as `grads`, where every non-None value in `grads`
      is divided by `LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale`.
