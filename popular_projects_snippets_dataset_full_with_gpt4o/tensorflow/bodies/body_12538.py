"""Returns local variables.

  Local variables - per process variables, usually not saved/restored to
  checkpoint and used for temporary or intermediate values.
  For example, they can be used as counters for metrics computation or
  number of epochs this machine has read data.
  The `tf.contrib.framework.local_variable()` function automatically adds the
  new variable to `GraphKeys.LOCAL_VARIABLES`.
  This convenience function returns the contents of that collection.

  An alternative to local variables are global variables. See
  `tf.compat.v1.global_variables`

  Args:
    scope: (Optional.) A string. If supplied, the resulting list is filtered to
      include only items whose `name` attribute matches `scope` using
      `re.match`. Items without a `name` attribute are never returned if a scope
      is supplied. The choice of `re.match` means that a `scope` without special
      tokens filters by prefix.

  Returns:
    A list of local `Variable` objects.
