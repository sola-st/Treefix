"""Register fetch and feed conversion functions for `tf.Session.run()`.

  This function registers a triple of conversion functions for fetching and/or
  feeding values of user-defined types in a call to tf.Session.run().

  An example

  ```python
     class SquaredTensor(object):
       def __init__(self, tensor):
         self.sq = tf.square(tensor)
     #you can define conversion functions as follows:
     fetch_function = lambda squared_tensor:([squared_tensor.sq],
                                             lambda val: val[0])
     feed_function = lambda feed, feed_val: [(feed.sq, feed_val)]
     feed_function_for_partial_run = lambda feed: [feed.sq]
     #then after invoking this register function, you can use as follows:
     session.run(squared_tensor1,
                 feed_dict = {squared_tensor2 : some_numpy_array})
  ```

  Args:
    tensor_type: The type for which you want to register a conversion function.
    fetch_function: A callable that takes an object of type `tensor_type` and
      returns a tuple, where the first element is a list of `tf.Tensor` objects,
      and the second element is a callable that takes a list of ndarrays and
      returns an object of some value type that corresponds to `tensor_type`.
      fetch_function describes how to expand fetch into its component Tensors
      and how to contract the fetched results back into a single return value.
    feed_function: A callable that takes feed_key and feed_value as input, and
      returns a list of tuples (feed_tensor, feed_val), feed_key must have type
      `tensor_type`, and feed_tensor must have type `tf.Tensor`. Each feed
      function describes how to unpack a single fed value and map it to feeds of
      one or more tensors and their corresponding values.
    feed_function_for_partial_run: A callable for specifying tensor values to
      feed when setting up a partial run, which takes a `tensor_type` type
      object as input, and returns a list of Tensors.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `tensor_type` has already been registered.
