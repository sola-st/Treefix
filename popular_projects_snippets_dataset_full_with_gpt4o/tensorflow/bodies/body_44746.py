"""Sets the AutoGraph verbosity level.

  _Debug logging in AutoGraph_

  More verbose logging is useful to enable when filing bug reports or doing
  more in-depth debugging.

  There are two means to control the logging verbosity:

   * The `set_verbosity` function

   * The `AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY` environment variable

  `set_verbosity` takes precedence over the environment variable.

  For example:

  ```python
  import os
  import tensorflow as tf

  os.environ['AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY'] = '5'
  # Verbosity is now 5

  tf.autograph.set_verbosity(0)
  # Verbosity is now 0

  os.environ['AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY'] = '1'
  # No effect, because set_verbosity was already called.
  ```

  Logs entries are output to [absl](https://abseil.io)'s
  [default output](https://abseil.io/docs/python/guides/logging),
  with `INFO` level.
  Logs can be mirrored to stdout by using the `alsologtostdout` argument.
  Mirroring is enabled by default when Python runs in interactive mode.

  Args:
    level: int, the verbosity level; larger values specify increased verbosity;
      0 means no logging. When reporting bugs, it is recommended to set this
      value to a larger number, like 10.
    alsologtostdout: bool, whether to also output log messages to `sys.stdout`.
