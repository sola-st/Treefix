"""Returns true iff the forward map `g` is injective (one-to-one function).

    **WARNING** This hidden property and its behavior are subject to change.

    Note:  Non-injective maps `g` are supported, provided their domain `D` can
    be partitioned into `k` disjoint subsets, `Union{D1, ..., Dk}`, such that,
    ignoring sets of measure zero, the restriction of `g` to each subset is a
    differentiable bijection onto `g(D)`.

    Returns:
      is_injective: Python `bool`.
