"""Applies cosine decay to the learning rate.

  When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
  the training progresses.  This function applies a cosine decay function
  to a provided initial learning rate.  It requires a `global_step` value to
  compute the decayed learning rate.  You can just pass a TensorFlow variable
  that you increment at each training step.

  The function returns the decayed learning rate.  It is computed as:
  ```python
  global_step = min(global_step, decay_steps)
  cosine_decay = 0.5 * (1 + cos(pi * global_step / decay_steps))
  decayed = (1 - alpha) * cosine_decay + alpha
  decayed_learning_rate = learning_rate * decayed
  ```

  Example usage:
  ```python
  decay_steps = 1000
  lr_decayed = cosine_decay(learning_rate, global_step, decay_steps)
  ```

  Args:
    learning_rate: A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number.
      The initial learning rate.
    global_step: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Global
      step to use for the decay computation.
    decay_steps: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Number
      of steps to decay over.
    alpha: A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. Minimum
      learning rate value as a fraction of learning_rate.
    name: String. Optional name of the operation.  Defaults to 'CosineDecay'.

  Returns:
    A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`.  The decayed
    learning rate.
  Raises:
    ValueError: if `global_step` is not supplied.

  @compatibility(eager)
  When eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in
  turn returns the decayed learning rate Tensor. This can be useful for changing
  the learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.
