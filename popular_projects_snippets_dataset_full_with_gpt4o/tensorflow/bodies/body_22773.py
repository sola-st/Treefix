"""Import a GraphDef and convert it to a textual MLIR module.

  This API is only intended for inspecting the internals of TensorFlow and the
  string returned is at the moment intended for debugging purposes.

  Args:
    graph_def: An object of type graph_pb2.GraphDef or a textual proto
      representation of a valid GraphDef.
    pass_pipeline: A textual description of an MLIR Pass Pipeline to run on the
      module, see MLIR documentation for the
      [textual pass pipeline syntax](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/PassManagement/#textual-pass-pipeline-specification).
    show_debug_info: Whether to include locations in the emitted textual form.

  Returns:
    A textual representation of the MLIR module corresponding to the graphdef.

  Raises:
    InvalidArgumentError: if graph_def is invalid or cannot be converted to
      MLIR.
