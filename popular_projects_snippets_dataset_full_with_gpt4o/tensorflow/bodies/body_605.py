"""Patch `doctest.compile` to make doctest to behave like a notebook.

  Default settings for doctest are configured to run like a repl: one statement
  at a time. The doctest source uses `compile(..., mode="single")`

  So to let doctest act like a notebook:

  1. We need `mode="exec"` (easy)
  2. We need the last expression to be printed (harder).

  To print the last expression, just wrap the last expression in
  `_print_if_not_none(expr)`. To detect the last expression use `AST`.
  If the last node is an expression modify the ast to call
  `_print_if_not_none` on it, convert the ast back to source and compile that.

  https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile

  Args:
    source: Can either be a normal string, a byte string, or an AST object.
    filename: Argument should give the file from which the code was read; pass
      some recognizable value if it wasnâ€™t read from a file ('<string>' is
      commonly used).
    mode: [Ignored] always use exec.
    flags: Compiler options.
    dont_inherit: Compiler options.
    optimize: Compiler options.

  Returns:
    The resulting code object.
