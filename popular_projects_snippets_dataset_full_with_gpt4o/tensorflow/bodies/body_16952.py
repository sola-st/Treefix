"""Computes and returns the noise-contrastive estimation training loss.

  A common use case is to use this method for training, and calculate the full
  sigmoid loss for evaluation or inference. In this case, you must set
  `partition_strategy="div"` for the two losses to be consistent, as in the
  following example:

  ```python
  if mode == "train":
    loss = tf.nn.nce_loss(
        weights=weights,
        biases=biases,
        labels=labels,
        inputs=inputs,
        ...,
        partition_strategy="div")
  elif mode == "eval":
    logits = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights))
    logits = tf.nn.bias_add(logits, biases)
    labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, n_classes)
    loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels=labels_one_hot,
        logits=logits)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss, axis=1)
  ```

  Note: By default this uses a log-uniform (Zipfian) distribution for sampling,
  so your labels must be sorted in order of decreasing frequency to achieve
  good results.  For more details, see
  `tf.random.log_uniform_candidate_sampler`.

  Note: In the case where `num_true` > 1, we assign to each target class
  the target probability 1 / `num_true` so that the target probabilities
  sum to 1 per-example.

  Note: It would be useful to allow a variable number of target classes per
  example.  We hope to provide this functionality in a future release.
  For now, if you have a variable number of target classes, you can pad them
  out to a constant number by either repeating them or by padding
  with an otherwise unused class.

  Args:
    weights: A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes, dim]`, or a list of `Tensor`
        objects whose concatenation along dimension 0 has shape
        [num_classes, dim].  The (possibly-partitioned) class embeddings.
    biases: A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes]`.  The class biases.
    labels: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size,
        num_true]`. The target classes.
    inputs: A `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, dim]`.  The forward
        activations of the input network.
    num_sampled: An `int`.  The number of negative classes to randomly sample
        per batch. This single sample of negative classes is evaluated for each
        element in the batch.
    num_classes: An `int`. The number of possible classes.
    num_true: An `int`.  The number of target classes per training example.
    sampled_values: a tuple of (`sampled_candidates`, `true_expected_count`,
        `sampled_expected_count`) returned by a `*_candidate_sampler` function.
        (if None, we default to `log_uniform_candidate_sampler`)
    remove_accidental_hits:  A `bool`.  Whether to remove "accidental hits"
        where a sampled class equals one of the target classes.  If set to
        `True`, this is a "Sampled Logistic" loss instead of NCE, and we are
        learning to generate log-odds instead of log probabilities. See
        our Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference
        ([pdf](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf)).
        Default is False.
    partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
        if `len(weights) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported.
        Default is `"mod"`. See `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for more details.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A `batch_size` 1-D tensor of per-example NCE losses.
