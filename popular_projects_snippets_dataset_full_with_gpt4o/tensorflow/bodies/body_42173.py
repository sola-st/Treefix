"""Push metadata about a context switch onto the stack.

    A context switch can take any one of the two forms: installing a graph as
    the default graph, or entering the eager context. For each context switch,
    we record whether or not the entered context is building a function.

    Args:
      is_building_function: (bool.) Whether the context is building a function.
      enter_context_fn: (function.) A callable that executes the context switch.
        For example, `graph.as_default` or `eager_mode`.
      device_stack: If applicable, the device function stack for this graph.
        When breaking out of graphs in init_scope, the innermost nonempty device
        stack is used. Eager contexts put `None` here and the value is never
        used.
