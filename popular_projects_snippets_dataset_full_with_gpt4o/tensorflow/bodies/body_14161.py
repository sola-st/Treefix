"""Returns the specified piece of this StructuredTensor.

    * If `struct_tensor` is scalar (i.e., a single structure), then
      `struct_tensor[f]` returns the value of field `f` (where `f` must be a
      string).

    * If `struct_tensor` is non-scalar (i.e., a vector or higher-dimensional
      tensor of structures), `struct_tensor[i]` selects an element or slice of
      the tensor using standard Python semantics (e.g., negative values index
      from the end).  `i` may have any of the following types:

      * `int` constant
      * `string` constant
      * scalar integer `Tensor`
      * `slice` containing integer constants and/or scalar integer
        `Tensor`s

    #### Multidimensional indexing

    `StructuredTensor` supports multidimensional indexing.  I.e., `key` may be a
    `tuple` of values, indexing or slicing multiple dimensions at once.  For
    example, if `people` is a vector of structures, each of which has a vector-
    valued `names` field, then `people[3, 'names', 0]` is equivalent to
    `people[3]['names'][0]`; and `people[:, 'names', :]` will return a (possibly
    ragged) matrix of names, with shape `[num_people, num_names_per_person]`.

    Args:
      key: Indicates which piece of the StructuredTensor to return.

    Returns:
      A `Tensor`, `StructuredTensor`, or `RaggedTensor`.
