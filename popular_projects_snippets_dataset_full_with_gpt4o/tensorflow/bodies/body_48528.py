"""Return the size (number of batches) for the dataset created.

    For certain type of the data input, the number of batches is known, eg for
    Numpy data, the size is same as (number_of_element / batch_size). Whereas
    for dataset or python generator, the size is unknown since it may or may not
    have a end state.

    Returns:
      int, the number of batches for the dataset, or None if it is unknown. The
      caller could use this to control the loop of training, show progress bar,
      or handle unexpected StopIteration error.
