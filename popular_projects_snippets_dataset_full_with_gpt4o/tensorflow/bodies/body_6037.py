"""Reduce `value` across replicas.

    In `OneDeviceStrategy`, there is only one replica, so if axis=None, value
    is simply returned. If axis is specified as something other than None,
    such as axis=0, value is reduced along that axis and returned.

    Example:
    ```
    t = tf.range(10)

    result = strategy.reduce(tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM, t, axis=None).numpy()
    # result: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    result = strategy.reduce(tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM, t, axis=0).numpy()
    # result: 45
    ```

    Args:
      reduce_op: A `tf.distribute.ReduceOp` value specifying how values should
        be combined.
      value: A "per replica" value, e.g. returned by `run` to
        be combined into a single tensor.
      axis: Specifies the dimension to reduce along within each
        replica's tensor. Should typically be set to the batch dimension, or
        `None` to only reduce across replicas (e.g. if the tensor has no batch
        dimension).

    Returns:
      A `Tensor`.
