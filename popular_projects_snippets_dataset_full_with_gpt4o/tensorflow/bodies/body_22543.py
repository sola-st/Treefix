"""Creates a `SaveSpec` object.

      tensor: the tensor to save or callable that produces a tensor to save.
        If the value is `None`, the `SaveSpec` is ignored.
      slice_spec: the slice to be saved. See `Variable.SaveSliceInfo`.
      name: the name to save the tensor under.
      dtype: The data type of the Tensor. Required if `tensor` is callable.
        Used for error checking in the restore op.
      device: The device generating and consuming this tensor. Required if
        `tensor` is callable. Used to group objects to save by device.
