"""Returns a `tf.TensorShape` that represents the shape of this tensor.

    >>> t = tf.constant([1,2,3,4,5])
    >>> t.shape
    TensorShape([5])

    `tf.Tensor.shape` is equivalent to `tf.Tensor.get_shape()`.

    In a `tf.function` or when building a model using
    `tf.keras.Input`, they return the build-time shape of the
    tensor, which may be partially unknown.

    A `tf.TensorShape` is not a tensor. Use `tf.shape(t)` to get a tensor
    containing the shape, calculated at runtime.

    See `tf.Tensor.get_shape()`, and `tf.TensorShape` for details and examples.
