"""Covariance.

    Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

    For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
    as,

    ```none
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
    ```

    where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E`
    denotes expectation.

    Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g.,
    matrix-valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices
    under some vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    ```none
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    ```

    where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices,
    `0 <= (i, j) < k' = reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function
    mapping indices of this distribution's event dimensions to indices of a
    length-`k'` vector.

    Args:
      name: Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.

    Returns:
      covariance: Floating-point `Tensor` with shape `[B1, ..., Bn, k', k']`
        where the first `n` dimensions are batch coordinates and
        `k' = reduce_prod(self.event_shape)`.
