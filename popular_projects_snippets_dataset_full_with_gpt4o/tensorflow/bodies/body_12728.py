"""Return the gradients for the 2 inputs of bias_op.

  The first input of unused_bias_op is the tensor t, and its gradient is
  just the gradient the unused_bias_op received.

  The second input of unused_bias_op is the bias vector which has one fewer
  dimension than "received_grad" (the batch dimension.)  Its gradient is the
  received gradient Summed on the batch dimension, which is the first dimension.

  Args:
    unused_bias_op: The BiasOp for which we need to generate gradients.
    received_grad: Tensor.  The gradients passed to the BiasOp.

  Returns:
    Two tensors, the first one for the "tensor" input of the BiasOp,
    the second one for the "bias" input of the BiasOp.
