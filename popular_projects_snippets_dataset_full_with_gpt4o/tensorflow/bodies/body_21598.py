"""Called once before using the session.

    When called, the default graph is the one that will be launched in the
    session.  The hook can modify the graph by adding new operations to it.
    After the `begin()` call the graph will be finalized and the other callbacks
    can not modify the graph anymore. Second call of `begin()` on the same
    graph, should not change the graph.
