"""Applies a function to each individual assignment.

  This function can process a possibly-unpacked (e.g. a, b = c, d) assignment.
  It tries to break down the unpacking if possible. In effect, it has the same
  effect as passing the assigned values in SSA form to apply_fn.

  Examples:

  The following will result in apply_fn(a, c), apply_fn(b, d):

      a, b = c, d

  The following will result in apply_fn(a, c[0]), apply_fn(b, c[1]):

      a, b = c

  The following will result in apply_fn(a, (b, c)):

      a = b, c

  It uses the visitor pattern to allow subclasses to process single
  assignments individually.

  Args:
    targets: Union[List[ast.AST, ...], Tuple[ast.AST, ...], ast.AST, should be
        used with the targets field of an ast.Assign node
    values: ast.AST
    apply_fn: Callable[[ast.AST, ast.AST], None], called with the
        respective nodes of each single assignment
