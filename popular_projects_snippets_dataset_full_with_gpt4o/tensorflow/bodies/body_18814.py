"""Interpolation formula inspired by section 4 of (Davis et al., 2006).

      Note here we derive & use a closed formula not present in the paper
      - as follows:
      Modeling all of TP (true positive weight),
      FP (false positive weight) and their sum P = TP + FP (positive weight)
      as varying linearly within each interval [A, B] between successive
      thresholds, we get
        Precision = (TP_A + slope * (P - P_A)) / P
      with slope = dTP / dP = (TP_B - TP_A) / (P_B - P_A).
      The area within the interval is thus (slope / total_pos_weight) times
        int_A^B{Precision.dP} = int_A^B{(TP_A + slope * (P - P_A)) * dP / P}
        int_A^B{Precision.dP} = int_A^B{slope * dP + intercept * dP / P}
      where intercept = TP_A - slope * P_A = TP_B - slope * P_B, resulting in
        int_A^B{Precision.dP} = TP_B - TP_A + intercept * log(P_B / P_A)
      Bringing back the factor (slope / total_pos_weight) we'd put aside, we get
         slope * [dTP + intercept *  log(P_B / P_A)] / total_pos_weight
      where dTP == TP_B - TP_A.
      Note that when P_A == 0 the above calculation simplifies into
        int_A^B{Precision.dTP} = int_A^B{slope * dTP} = slope * (TP_B - TP_A)
      which is really equivalent to imputing constant precision throughout the
      first bucket having >0 true positives.

      Args:
        tp: true positive counts
        fp: false positive counts
        fn: false negative counts

      Returns:
        pr_auc: an approximation of the area under the P-R curve.
