"""Creates a new variable with value `initial_value`.

    Args:
      initial_value: A `Tensor`, or Python object convertible to a `Tensor`,
        which is the initial value for the Variable. The initial value must have
        a shape specified unless `validate_shape` is set to False. Can also be a
        callable with no argument that returns the initial value when called. In
        that case, `dtype` must be specified. (Note that initializer functions
        from init_ops.py must first be bound to a shape before being used here.)
      trainable: If `True`, GradientTapes automatically watch uses of this
        variable. Defaults to `True`, unless `synchronization` is set to
        `ON_READ`, in which case it defaults to `False`.
      validate_shape: If `False`, allows the variable to be initialized with a
        value of unknown shape. If `True`, the default, the shape of
        `initial_value` must be known.
      caching_device: Note: This argument is only valid when using a v1-style
        `Session`. Optional device string describing where the Variable should
        be cached for reading. Defaults to the Variable's device. If not `None`,
        caches on another device. Typical use is to cache on the device where
        the Ops using the Variable reside, to deduplicate copying through
        `Switch` and other conditional statements.
      name: Optional name for the variable. Defaults to `'Variable'` and gets
        uniquified automatically.
      variable_def: `VariableDef` protocol buffer. If not `None`, recreates the
        Variable object with its contents, referencing the variable's nodes in
        the graph, which must already exist. The graph is not changed.
        `variable_def` and the other arguments are mutually exclusive.
      dtype: If set, initial_value will be converted to the given type. If
        `None`, either the datatype will be kept (if `initial_value` is a
        Tensor), or `convert_to_tensor` will decide.
      import_scope: Optional `string`. Name scope to add to the `Variable.` Only
        used when initializing from protocol buffer.
      constraint: An optional projection function to be applied to the variable
        after being updated by an `Optimizer` (e.g. used to implement norm
        constraints or value constraints for layer weights). The function must
        take as input the unprojected Tensor representing the value of the
        variable and return the Tensor for the projected value (which must have
        the same shape). Constraints are not safe to use when doing asynchronous
        distributed training.
      synchronization: Indicates when a distributed a variable will be
        aggregated. Accepted values are constants defined in the class
        `tf.VariableSynchronization`. By default the synchronization is set to
        `AUTO` and the current `DistributionStrategy` chooses when to
        synchronize.
      aggregation: Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.
        Accepted values are constants defined in the class
        `tf.VariableAggregation`.
      shape: (optional) The shape of this variable. If None, the shape of
        `initial_value` will be used. When setting this argument to
        `tf.TensorShape(None)` (representing an unspecified shape), the variable
        can be assigned with values of different shapes.
      experimental_enable_variable_lifting: Whether to lift the variable out if
        it's in a `tf.function`. Default is `True`. When this argument
        is `True`, variable creation will follow the behavior and
        restrictions described
        [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#creating_tfvariables).
        If this argument is `False`, that description doesn't apply,
        and you can freely create and use the variable in the
        `tf.function`, as if it's a "mutable `tf.Tensor`". You can't
        return the variable though.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If both `variable_def` and initial_value are specified.
      ValueError: If the initial value is not specified, or does not have a
        shape and `validate_shape` is `True`.
