"""Returns True if `self` is a subtype of `other`.

    For example, `tf.function` uses subtyping for dispatch:
    if `a.is_subtype_of(b)` is True, then an argument of `TraceType`
    `a` can be used as argument to a `ConcreteFunction` traced with an
    a `TraceType` `b`.

    Args:
     other: A TraceType object to be compared against.

    Example:

    ```python
    class Dimension(TraceType):
      def __init__(self, value: Optional[int]):
        self.value = value

      def is_subtype_of(self, other):
        # Either the value is the same or other has a generalized value that
        # can represent any specific ones.
        return (self.value == other.value) or (other.value is None)
    ```
