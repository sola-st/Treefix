"""The operation that failed, if known.

    *N.B.* If the failed op was synthesized at runtime, e.g. a `Send`
    or `Recv` op, there will be no corresponding
    `tf.Operation`
    object.  In that case, this will return `None`, and you should
    instead use the `tf.errors.OpError.node_def` to
    discover information about the op.

    Returns:
      The `Operation` that failed, or None.
