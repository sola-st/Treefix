"""Construct a subgraph for shuffle all-reduce.

  Shuffle reduce is essentially the algorithm implemented when using
  parameter servers.  Suppose tensor length is n, there are d devices
  and g gather shards.  Each device sends a n/g length sub-tensor to
  each gather shard.  The gather shards perform a reduction across d
  fragments, then broadcast the result back to each device.  The
  devices then join the g fully reduced fragments they receive from
  the shards.  The gather shards could perform d-1 pairwise
  reductions, or one d-way reduction.  The first is better where
  reduction Op time is low compared to transmission time, the second
  better in the other case.

  Args:
    input_tensors: list of `tf.Tensor` values to be reduced.
    gather_devices: list of names of devices on which reduction shards
      should be placed.
    red_op: an n-array elementwise reduction Op
    un_op: optional elementwise unary Op to be applied to fully-reduced values.

  Returns:
    list of `tf.Tensor` which are the fully reduced tensors.
