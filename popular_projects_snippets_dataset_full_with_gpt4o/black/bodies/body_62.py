        Returns:
            * Ok(string_indices) such that for each index, `line.leaves[index]`
            is our target string if a match was able to be made. For
            transformers that don't result in more lines (e.g. StringMerger,
            StringParenStripper), multiple matches and transforms are done at
            once to reduce the complexity.
                OR
            * Err(CannotTransform), if no match could be made.
