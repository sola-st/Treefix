"""Creates a null session which acts as a replacement object if the
        real session support could not be loaded due to a configuration
        error.  This mainly aids the user experience because the job of the
        null session is to still support lookup without complaining but
        modifications are answered with a helpful error message of what
        failed.

        This creates an instance of :attr:`null_session_class` by default.
