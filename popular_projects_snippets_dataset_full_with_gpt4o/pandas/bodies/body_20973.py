# Extracted from ./data/repos/pandas/pandas/core/arrays/datetimes.py
"""
    If the given dtype is a DatetimeTZDtype, extract the implied
    tzinfo object from it and check that it does not conflict with the given
    tz.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : dtype, str
    tz : None, tzinfo
    explicit_tz_none : bool, default False
        Whether tz=None was passed explicitly, as opposed to lib.no_default.

    Returns
    -------
    tz : consensus tzinfo

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError : on tzinfo mismatch
