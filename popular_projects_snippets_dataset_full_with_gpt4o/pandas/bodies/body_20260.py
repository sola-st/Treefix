"""
    Convenience function for interpolate.BPoly.from_derivatives.

    Construct a piecewise polynomial in the Bernstein basis, compatible
    with the specified values and derivatives at breakpoints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xi : array-like
        sorted 1D array of x-coordinates
    yi : array-like or list of array-likes
        yi[i][j] is the j-th derivative known at xi[i]
    order: None or int or array-like of ints. Default: None.
        Specifies the degree of local polynomials. If not None, some
        derivatives are ignored.
    der : int or list
        How many derivatives to extract; None for all potentially nonzero
        derivatives (that is a number equal to the number of points), or a
        list of derivatives to extract. This number includes the function
        value as 0th derivative.
     extrapolate : bool, optional
        Whether to extrapolate to ouf-of-bounds points based on first and last
        intervals, or to return NaNs. Default: True.

    Returns
    -------
    y : scalar or array-like
        The result, of length R or length M or M by R.
