"""
    Decorator to forbid specific types for a method of StringMethods.

    For calling `.str.{method}` on a Series or Index, it is necessary to first
    initialize the :class:`StringMethods` object, and then call the method.
    However, different methods allow different input types, and so this can not
    be checked during :meth:`StringMethods.__init__`, but must be done on a
    per-method basis. This decorator exists to facilitate this process, and
    make it explicit which (inferred) types are disallowed by the method.

    :meth:`StringMethods.__init__` allows the *union* of types its different
    methods allow (after skipping NaNs; see :meth:`StringMethods._validate`),
    namely: ['string', 'empty', 'bytes', 'mixed', 'mixed-integer'].

    The default string types ['string', 'empty'] are allowed for all methods.
    For the additional types ['bytes', 'mixed', 'mixed-integer'], each method
    then needs to forbid the types it is not intended for.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forbidden : list-of-str or None
        List of forbidden non-string types, may be one or more of
        `['bytes', 'mixed', 'mixed-integer']`.
    name : str, default None
        Name of the method to use in the error message. By default, this is
        None, in which case the name from the method being wrapped will be
        copied. However, for working with further wrappers (like _pat_wrapper
        and _noarg_wrapper), it is necessary to specify the name.

    Returns
    -------
    func : wrapper
        The method to which the decorator is applied, with an added check that
        enforces the inferred type to not be in the list of forbidden types.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the inferred type of the underlying data is in `forbidden`.
