"""
    Convenience function for cubic spline data interpolator.

    See `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xi : array-like, shape (n,)
        1-d array containing values of the independent variable.
        Values must be real, finite and in strictly increasing order.
    yi : array-like
        Array containing values of the dependent variable. It can have
        arbitrary number of dimensions, but the length along ``axis``
        (see below) must match the length of ``x``. Values must be finite.
    x : scalar or array-like, shape (m,)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which `y` is assumed to be varying. Meaning that for
        ``x[i]`` the corresponding values are ``np.take(y, i, axis=axis)``.
        Default is 0.
    bc_type : string or 2-tuple, optional
        Boundary condition type. Two additional equations, given by the
        boundary conditions, are required to determine all coefficients of
        polynomials on each segment [2]_.
        If `bc_type` is a string, then the specified condition will be applied
        at both ends of a spline. Available conditions are:
        * 'not-a-knot' (default): The first and second segment at a curve end
          are the same polynomial. It is a good default when there is no
          information on boundary conditions.
        * 'periodic': The interpolated functions is assumed to be periodic
          of period ``x[-1] - x[0]``. The first and last value of `y` must be
          identical: ``y[0] == y[-1]``. This boundary condition will result in
          ``y'[0] == y'[-1]`` and ``y''[0] == y''[-1]``.
        * 'clamped': The first derivative at curves ends are zero. Assuming
          a 1D `y`, ``bc_type=((1, 0.0), (1, 0.0))`` is the same condition.
        * 'natural': The second derivative at curve ends are zero. Assuming
          a 1D `y`, ``bc_type=((2, 0.0), (2, 0.0))`` is the same condition.
        If `bc_type` is a 2-tuple, the first and the second value will be
        applied at the curve start and end respectively. The tuple values can
        be one of the previously mentioned strings (except 'periodic') or a
        tuple `(order, deriv_values)` allowing to specify arbitrary
        derivatives at curve ends:
        * `order`: the derivative order, 1 or 2.
        * `deriv_value`: array-like containing derivative values, shape must
          be the same as `y`, excluding ``axis`` dimension. For example, if
          `y` is 1D, then `deriv_value` must be a scalar. If `y` is 3D with
          the shape (n0, n1, n2) and axis=2, then `deriv_value` must be 2D
          and have the shape (n0, n1).
    extrapolate : {bool, 'periodic', None}, optional
        If bool, determines whether to extrapolate to out-of-bounds points
        based on first and last intervals, or to return NaNs. If 'periodic',
        periodic extrapolation is used. If None (default), ``extrapolate`` is
        set to 'periodic' for ``bc_type='periodic'`` and to True otherwise.
