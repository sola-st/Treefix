"""
        Write a DataFrame to the ORC format.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str, file-like object or None, default None
            If a string, it will be used as Root Directory path
            when writing a partitioned dataset. By file-like object,
            we refer to objects with a write() method, such as a file handle
            (e.g. via builtin open function). If path is None,
            a bytes object is returned.
        engine : str, default 'pyarrow'
            ORC library to use. Pyarrow must be >= 7.0.0.
        index : bool, optional
            If ``True``, include the dataframe's index(es) in the file output.
            If ``False``, they will not be written to the file.
            If ``None``, similar to ``infer`` the dataframe's index(es)
            will be saved. However, instead of being saved as values,
            the RangeIndex will be stored as a range in the metadata so it
            doesn't require much space and is faster. Other indexes will
            be included as columns in the file output.
        engine_kwargs : dict[str, Any] or None, default None
            Additional keyword arguments passed to :func:`pyarrow.orc.write_table`.

        Returns
        -------
        bytes if no path argument is provided else None

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            Dtype of one or more columns is category, unsigned integers, interval,
            period or sparse.
        ValueError
            engine is not pyarrow.

        --------
        read_orc : Read a ORC file.
        DataFrame.to_parquet : Write a parquet file.
        DataFrame.to_csv : Write a csv file.
        DataFrame.to_sql : Write to a sql table.
        DataFrame.to_hdf : Write to hdf.

        Notes
        -----
        * Before using this function you should read the :ref:`user guide about
          ORC <io.orc>` and :ref:`install optional dependencies <install.warn_orc>`.
        * This function requires `pyarrow <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/>`_
          library.
        * For supported dtypes please refer to `supported ORC features in Arrow
          <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/orc.html#data-types>`__.
        * Currently timezones in datetime columns are not preserved when a
          dataframe is converted into ORC files.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data={'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [4, 3]})
        >>> df.to_orc('df.orc')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> pd.read_orc('df.orc')  # doctest: +SKIP
           col1  col2
        0     1     4
        1     2     3

        If you want to get a buffer to the orc content you can write it to io.BytesIO
        >>> import io
        >>> b = io.BytesIO(df.to_orc())  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> b.seek(0)  # doctest: +SKIP
        0
        >>> content = b.read()  # doctest: +SKIP
