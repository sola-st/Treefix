"""
        Check that indexer can be used to return a result.

        e.g. at least one element was found,
        unless the list of keys was actually empty.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : list-like
            Targeted labels (only used to show correct error message).
        indexer: array-like of booleans
            Indices corresponding to the key,
            (with -1 indicating not found).
        axis_name : str

        Raises
        ------
        KeyError
            If at least one key was requested but none was found.
